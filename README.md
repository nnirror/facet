## Overview

Facet is an open-source live coding system for algorithmic music and synthesis. With a code editor in the browser and a pair of NodeJS servers running locally on your machine, Facet can generate and sequence audio, MIDI, OSC, and image data.

Facet runs on MacOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Installation and getting started

1. Download and install Node.js (must be v14 or greater) and npm: https://www.npmjs.com/get-np
2. Download or clone the Facet repository.
3. In a terminal, navigate to the root of the Facet repository, and run `npm install`.
4. After the previous command completes, run `npm run facet`. This will start the servers that run in the background for generating and patterns and keeping time. If running on Windows: Windows has a firewall by default for local connections (on the same private network), and it needs to be disabled, or you can manually allow the connection via the confirmation dialog from the Windows firewall system when starting up the servers.
5. In a browser tab (Firefox or Chrome work best), navigate to http://localhost:1124. This is the browser-based code editor which can also handle stereo audio playback.
6. Copy this command into the code editor in the browser: `$('test').sine(100).play();` Move your cursor so it's on the line. Hit `[ctrl + enter]` to run the command. The code editor application will always briefly highlights to illustrate what command(s) ran. You should hear a sine wave playing through your browser tab. Hit `[ctrl + .]` or `[ctrl + /]` (Windows) to stop.

## Facet commands

### Syntax

Facet commands are based entirely around JavaScript, using a class called a `FacetPattern`. In order to produce audio or MIDI output, create an instance of a FacetPattern, and run some methods:

`new FacetPattern('example').sine(100).play();`

There is a shorthand for creating a new FacetPattern instance:

`$('example').sine(100).play();`

Some FacetPatterns might contain other FacetPatterns. The most outer-facing one must have a name via the above method `$()`, but other FacetPatterns inside the code can use a separate, more concise shorthand, `_`:

`$('example').sine(100).times(_.sine(100)).play();`

There are lots of methods to generate, translate, and orchestrate playback on FacetPattern data:

`$('example').sine(100).times(random()).play();`
`// each time you run ^, the same sine wave at a different volume`

Certain operations (e.g. `sometimes()`, `iter()`, `slices()`, `mix()`, `run()`) allow you to supply functions as arguments:

`$('example').iter(16,()=>{this.append(_.randsamp('808').speed(10))}).play();`
`// stitches together 16 random samples, each playing at 10x normal speed`

### UI controls in the browser

Below the text editor, there are several UI elements which control the servers running in the background. Moving from left to right:

- Server connection status indicator (green = online; red = offline)
- CPU% indicator
- Number input for setting the BPM of the global transport (_note_: when the `.bpm()` operation runs, this value updates automatically)
- Number inputs for setting the time signature numerator and denominator of the global transport. (_note_: when the `.time()` operation runs, these values update automatically)
- MIDI output selector / refresh button
- â–  = stop playback
- âŠ– = stop regenerating patterns but continue playback
- â†» = restart system (in case it becomes unresponsive)
- ðŸ”‰ = toggle browser sound on / off

### Key commands

- Run command(s): `[ctrl + enter]` or `[ctrl + r]`. All commands not separated by multiple newlines will run together.
- Stop command(s): `[ctrl + ']`. All commands not separated by multiple newlines will be stopped, if they are currently running.
- Keep command(s): `[ctrl + ;]`. All commands not separated by multiple newlines will continue to play back as-is, without regenerating.
- Once command(s): `[ctrl + \]`. All commands not separated by multiple newlines will play back once and not regenerate.
- Stop all playback: `[ctrl + .]` or `[ctrl + /]`
- Stop regenerating all patterns: `[ctrl + ,]`
- Autocomplete / list methods: `[ctrl + space]`. This will list all available methods including their arguments in a dropdown menu, filtered by the text preceding the cursor position. If only one matching method is found, it will autocomplete that method.
- Autoformat code: `[ctrl + f]`

### Running "npm run facet"

When you run the `npm run facet` command in the terminal, the following sequence of events occurs:

A server, known as the `process manager`, starts up on http://localhost:5831. This server is responsible for managing the startup and shutdown of the two servers listed below:

1. The `transport server` starts up on http://localhost:3211. This server is responsible for handling the timing and playback of audio, MIDI, and OSC events.

2. The `pattern generator` server starts up on http://localhost:1123. This server listens to requests from the text editor UI in the browser located at http://localhost:1124 and interprets those commands into data. If the pattern is intended to be played back as audio, a corresponding .wav file will be stored in the `tmp/` subdirectory in the Facet repo. Otherwise, if the pattern is intended for MIDI or OSC output, the data will be posted directly to the transport server.

#### Configuration for Max

It is possible to send data from Facet into a Max patch using a custom `facet.maxpat` object which is included in this repository. First, follow these setup steps:

1. Open Max. In the Max navbar, go to > Options > File Preferences, click "Add Path", and add the facet directory (the folder that contains this file). Make sure that the Subfolders checkbox is checked.
2. Create a new Max patcher, and add a `facet` object.
3. The single outlet in the `facet` object will pass OSC commands from Facet into your patcher. Use the `/route` Max object to route the OSC data in your Max patcher.
4. See the `examples/osc.md` example file for more details on receiving OSC in Max or any other application.

### Variables

#### mousex / mousey

Both `mousex` and `mousey`, as floating-point number representations of your cursor's position _in the browser window_, are available for use in commands, e.g.:

```
$('example').sine(100).times(mousey).play(); // cursor y position controls volume every time the code runs
```

#### notevalues

There are 128 notevalues variables, corresponding to divisions of 1 whole note. A whole note is `n1`, a half note is `n2`, etc... up to `n128`.

#### bpm

The variable `bpm` represents the current BPM in the Facet transport when the FacetPattern is generated.

#### bars

The variable `bars` represents how many loops have occurred since the time the server was started. This is especially useful with the modulo % operator, e.g.: `bars%4`, which could be either 0, 1, 2, or 3, depending on how many loops have occurred.

#### time signature

The variables `time_num` and `time_denom` represent the current time signature of the Facet transport. These variables will update when you modify either the `time signature numerator` or `time signature denominator` number inputs in the user interface, or if the `time()` method is dynamically updating the time signature.

## Sample rate

You can change the sample rate for the audio generated and played back with Facet by modifying `SAMPLE_RATE` in `js/config.js` to whatever integer you want.

In Facet commands, you can use the constant `SAMPLE_RATE` to refer to the configured sample rate, which is useful when you want to do something for a specific number of seconds. The constant `NYQUIST` refers to the Nyquist frequency which is `SAMPLE_RATE/2`.

For example: `$('example').noise(SAMPLE_RATE).play(); // generate and continually play back exactly 1 second of noise`

## Global event resolution

By default, Facet checks every 10 milliseconds whether it needs to fire any events that produce output, such as playing audio, MIDI, or osc. You can change  `EVENT_RESOLUTION_MS` in `js/config.js` to set a different integer value. Slower speeds (e.g. 20 = 20ms) will produce less tightly-timed events but can help make it possible for Facet to run on computers with less CPU resources, at the expense of slight timing accuracy. Faster speeds (e.g. 4 = 4ms) will produce tighter event scheduling but can overload computers with less CPU resources.

## Command reference

### Outputs

Facet can synthesize and orchestrate the playback of multiple FacetPatterns simultaneously, producing audio, MIDI, or OSC output. By default, patterns will continually regenerate each loop. In order to only regenerate every n loops, use the `.whenmod()` method. In order to continue playing a pattern and not regenerate, use the `.keep()` method. In order to only play back once, use the `.once()` method.

### Audio output
- **play** ( _PlaybackFacetPattern_, _pitchSequenceData_ = 1 )
	- plays the FacetPattern as audio, at however many positions are specified in `PlaybackFacetPattern`, as the global transport loops through a whole note.
	- `PlaybackFacetPattern` should contain floating-point numbers between 0 and 1, corresponding to the relative point in the transport between 0 and 1 when the generated audio should play.
	- `pitchSequenceData` is an optional argument that should contain an array of pitch shift values. These values are used to adjust the pitch of the sound at each step of the sequence. The pitch shift values are spread out over the sequence steps, so if there are fewer pitch shift values than sequence steps, the pitch shift values will be repeated.
	- With no arguments, the command will regenerate at point 0, i.e. at the beginning of each whole note. You can supply a number, array, or FacetPattern as the argument.
	- This command should go at the end of the chain of commands. Applying further operations after it could alter the sound. This is because `play()` works by superposing copies of the input FacetPattern at all the playback positions, rather than creating discrete events to fire at each playback position. This helps to keep timing tight, as there is only one event that fires per loop to actually play each voice of audio, and it's always at position 0, where it plays the entire superposed pattern.
	- By default, the FacetPattern will continue to regenerate and play. To prevent it from regenerating, include a `keep()` operation. To stop playback, use the key command `[ctrl + .]` or `[ctrl + /]`, or press the stop button "â– ".
	- example:
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').play();	// plays once at beginning of loop`
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').play(0.5);	// plays once at middle point`
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').play(_.noise(4));	// plays once at 4 random positions`
---
- **pan** ( _PanningFacetPattern_ 0 )
	- dynamically moves the FacetPattern between however many channels are specified in a seperate `.channels()` call. Without a call to `.channels()`, it will default to spatially positioning the FacetPattern between channels 1 and 2.
	- the values in `PanningFacetPattern` should be between 0 and 1. Values beyond that will be clipped to the 0 - 1 range. A value of 0 will hard-pan the sound to the first active channel that is set via a `.channels()` call (or defaulting to stereo). A value of 1 will hard-pan the sound to the last active channel. Values between 0 and 1 will crossfade between all the specified active channels.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(n1).times(_.ramp(1,0,n1)).pan(_.sine(1,n1).scale(0,1)).play(); // no channels are specified; defaults to stereo panning`
		- `$('example').noise(n1).times(_.ramp(1,0,n1)).channels([1,2,4]).pan(_.sine(1,n1).scale(0,1)).play(); // pans the noise smoothly around channels 1, 2, and 4`
---
- **channel** ( _channels_ )
	- Facet ultimately creates wav files that can have any number of channels. The `.channel()` method (and equivalent `channels()` method) allow you to route the output of a FacetPattern onto the specified channel(s) in the `channels` input array.
	- example:
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').channel(1).play(); // first channel only`
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').channels([1,3]).play(); // second channel only`
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').channel(_.from([9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16]).shuffle().reduce(ri(1,8))).play(); // play on a random number of channels from 9-16`
---
- **saveas** ( _filename_ )
	- saves a monophonic, 32-bit depth wav file in the `samples/` directory or a sub-directory, containing the FacetPattern. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created.
	- __Note__: this example uses MacOS / Linux file paths with forward slashes (e.g. `my/path/here`). For Windows, you will need to use back slashes (e.g `my\path\here`)
	- example:
		- `$('example').iter(6,()=>{this.append(_.sine(ri(1,40))).saveas('/myNoiseStuff/' + Date.now()`)}); // creates 6 wav files in the myNoiseStuff directory. Each filename is the UNIX timestamp to preserve order.
- **stop** ( )
	- stops the command from regenerating and playing back in future loops.
	- any time a `.stop()` is found in a command, the entire command will be skipped and not executed. This helps to preserve CPU.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(n16).play().stop(); // you only hear sound when you remove the stop()`
---

### MIDI / OSC output
You might need to activate a MIDI driver on your machine in order to send MIDI from Facet to a DAW. If Facet finds no MIDI drivers, the dropdown select UI in the browser will be empty, and if you try the below commands they will produce no output. Google "install MIDI driver {your OS goes here}" for more information.

You need to connect the MIDI device you want to use before starting Facet.

- **note** ( _VelocityPattern_ = 100, _DurationPattern_ = 125, _channel_ = 1, _PositionPattern_ )
	- sends a MIDI note on/off pair for every value in the FacetPattern's data.
	- the `VelocityPattern` and `DurationPattern` will automatically scale to match the note pattern. This allows you to modulate MIDI velocity and duration over the course of the whole note.
	- the `channel` argument by default sends the MIDI out channel 1. It can be set to any channel between 1-16.
	- the `PositionPattern` argument is optional. When not supplied, the positions will calculate automatically and spread pattern data across the entire whole note, playing the first value in the data at relative position 0, and playing the last value in the data at relative position 1. By supplying a `PositionPattern`, you can program when each note should play.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(1,32).scale(36,90).round().note();`
		- `$('example').sine(1,ri(32,100)).scale(36,ri(52,100)).prob(rf()).nonzero().round().note();`
		- `$('example').noise(16).scale(60,80).sort().note(100,125,1,_.ramp(0,0.25,16)); // play all notes during the first 25% of the whole note`
---
- **note2d** ( _VelocityPattern_ = 100, _DurationPattern_ = 125, _channel_ = 1, _lowNote_ = 0, _highNote_ = 127 )
    - sends a MIDI note on/off pair for every value in the FacetPattern's data, arranged as if it were a square 2D grid.
	- for more information on generating 2D patterns, see the `Methods for image generation and processing` section further below in the README document.
    - the `VelocityPattern` and `DurationPattern` will automatically scale to match the note pattern. This allows you to modulate MIDI velocity and duration over the course of the whole note.
    - the `channel` argument by default sends the MIDI out channel 1. It can be set to any channel between 1-16.
    - the `lowNote` and `highNote` arguments define the range of MIDI notes that can be played. By default, this range is from 0 (inclusive) to 127 (inclusive).
    - The data length must be a perfect square, as it is processed in columns to form a 2D grid of notes.
    - Example:
        - `$('example').silence(2500).circle2d(25,25,25,1).saveimg().note2d(100,125,1,30,80).once(); // saves 50x50 image with a circle in the middle; then plays that circle shape between the MIDI notes 30 and 80`
---
- **cc** ( _controller_number_ = 70, _channel_ = 1 )
	- sends a MIDI cc event bound to controller # `controller_number` for every value in the FacetPattern's data.
	- _Note_: This method is automatically scaled into the expected data range for MIDI CC data. It expects a FacetPattern of values between 0 and 1.
	- The `channel` argument by default sends the MIDI out channel 1. It can be set to any channel between 1-16.
	- example:
		- `$('example').drunk(64,0.1).cc();`
---
- **chord** ( _chordTypePattern_, _inversion_mode_ = 0 )
	- creates a chord of MIDI notes for every value in the FacetPattern's data.
	- `chordTypePattern` can be a string, or a FacetPattern, or an array of either. If `chordTypePattern` is a FacetPattern, the chord intervals will correspond to the data of the `chordTypePattern` FacetPattern.
	- if `chordTypePattern` is an array with more than one value in it, then the chord type will change dynamically over the course of the loop. For example, a `chordTypePattern` of ['major','maj7','minor'] will produce major chords for the first third of the loop, then switch to maj7 chords for the middle third, then switch to minor chords for the last third.
	- if `chordTypePattern` is a string, it must be from the below list of chord names:

	`maj` / `major` = `0,4,7`

	`min` / `minor` = `0,3,7`

	`fifth` / `5th` = `0,5`

	`seventh` / `7th` = `0,4,7,10`

	`major seventh` / `maj7` = `0,4,7,11`

	`minor seventh` / `m7` = `0,3,7,10`

	`diminished` / `dim` = `-1,2,5`

	`add2` = `0,2,4,7`

	`add9` = `0,4,7,14`

	- if `chord_type` is a string, the `inversion_mode` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. This number represents how many of the values in the chord have been inverted and are now below the root.
	- _Note_: to force chords into a certain key, use the `key()` operation _after_ the `chord()` operation.
	- example:
		- `$('example').ramp(36,72,32).chord('maj7').add((bars%4)*12).key('F#','major').note(50,100,1);`
		- `$('example').noise(16).scale(36,90).chord(_.from([3,5,7,10,11,14,16,20,25])).key('c','major').note(); // 9-note chords mapped onto c major`
		- `$('example').noise(8).scale(30,80).chord('maj7').key(['c','f#'], ['major','minor']).note(100,500); // maj7 chords, first in c major, then in f# minor`
---
- **key** ( _keyLetterPattern_, _keyScalePattern_ )
	- translates a FacetPattern with data in the range of MIDI note numbers (0-127) so all its values now adhere to the supplied `keyLetterPattern` and `keyScalePattern`.
	- `keyLetterPattern` values can be a string: "A", "A#", "B", "C", "C#", "D", "D#", "E", "F", "F#", "G", "G#", or an array, or strings: `["A", "D"]`, or a FacetPattern of strings: `_.from(['A','D']).dup(3).shuffle()`. When `keyLetterPattern` contains multiple values, the key will change dynamically over the course of the loop. So a `keyLetterPattern` of `["A", "D", "G"]` will be in the key of A for the first third, then switch to D for the middle third, then switch to G for the last third.
	- `keyScalePattern` values can either be a string (see list below), or a FacetPattern containing 1-12 binary numbers (see examples), or an array of strings/FacetPatterns, in which case the values change dynamically over the course of the loop.
	- possible scales: ["major pentatonic", "major", "minor", "major blues", "minor blues", "melodic minor", "harmonic minor", "bebop", "diminished", "dorian", "lydian", "mixolydian", "phrygian", "locrian", "ionian pentatonic", "mixolydian pentatonic", "ritusen", "egyptian", "neopolitan major pentatonic", "vietnamese 1", "pelog", "kumoijoshi", "hirajoshi", "iwato", "in-sen", "lydian pentatonic", "malkos raga", "locrian pentatonic", "minor pentatonic", "minor six pentatonic", "flat three pentatonic", "flat six pentatonic", "scriabin", "whole tone pentatonic", "lydian #5P pentatonic", "lydian dominant pentatonic", "minor #7M pentatonic", "super locrian pentatonic", "minor hexatonic", "augmented", "piongio", "prometheus neopolitan", "prometheus", "mystery #1", "six tone symmetric", "whole tone", "messiaen's mode #5", "locrian major", "double harmonic lydian", "altered", "locrian #2", "mixolydian b6", "lydian dominant", "lydian augmented", "dorian b2", "ultralocrian", "locrian 6", "augmented heptatonic", "dorian #4", "lydian diminished", "leading whole tone", "lydian minor", "phrygian dominant", "balinese", "neopolitan major", "harmonic major", "double harmonic major", "hungarian minor", "hungarian major", "oriental", "flamenco", "todi raga", "persian", "enigmatic", "major augmented", "lydian #9", "messiaen's mode #4", "purvi raga", "spanish heptatonic", "bebop minor", "bebop major", "bebop locrian", "minor bebop", "ichikosucho", "minor six diminished", "half-whole diminished", "kafi raga", "messiaen's mode #6", "composite blues", "messiaen's mode #3", "messiaen's mode #7", "chromatic"]
	- example: `$('example').randsamp('808').reduce(32).scale(36,51).key('F#', 'bebop').note();`
	- example: `$('example').noise(16).scale(30,80).key('c', _.from([1])).note(); // octave scale, via custom FacetPattern`
	- example: `$('example').noise(16).scale(30,80).key('c', _.from([1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0])).note(); // equivalent to the above custom octave scale; the padded zeroes are optional`
	- example: `$('example').noise(16).scale(30,80).key('c', _.from([1,0,0,0,0,0,1])).note(); // octave + perfect fifth scale, via custom FacetPattern`
	- example: `$('example').noise(16).scale(30,80).key(['c','f#'], ['major','minor']).note(); // the first half is c major; the second half is f# major`
---
- **osc** ( _address_ )
	- sends a packet of OSC data to OSC address `address` for every value in the FacetPattern's data.
	- The OSC server sends output to port 5813 by default. You can change to a different port by modifying `OSC_OUTPORT` in `js/config.js` to whatever port number you need.
	- The `address` argument must begin with a backslash: `/`.
	- _Note_: This method does _not_ automatically scale the FacetPattern values between 0 and 1, so the user can send any range of numbers over OSC.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(128).osc('/test');`
---
- **pitchbend** ( _channel_ = 1 )
	- sends a MIDI pitchbend event for every value in the FacetPattern's data.
	- The `channel` argument by default sends the MIDI out channel 1. It can be set to any channel between 1-16.
	- _Note_: This method is automatically scaled into the expected range for MIDI pitchbend data. It expects a FacetPattern of values between -1 and 1, with 0 meaning no pitchbend.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(1).size(128).pitchbend();`
---
- **savemidi** (_midifilename_ = Date.now(), _velocityPattern_ = 64, _durationPattern_ = 16, _wraps_ = 1, _tick_mode_ = false_)
	- creates a MIDI file of MIDI notes named `midifilename` in the `midi` directory, with the FacetPattern's data.
	- `VelocityPattern` and `DurationPattern` will automatically scale to match the note pattern. This allows you to modulate MIDI velocity and duration over the course of the whole note.
	- The `velocityPattern` expects values between 1 and 100. (This range is set by the midi-writer-js npm package).
	- The `wraps` parameter controls how many times to wrap the data back around onto itself, allowing for MIDI polyphony. For example, if your FacetPattern has 8 different 128-note patterns appended together in a sequence, a `wraps` of 8 would superpose all of those patterns on top of each other, while a `wraps` value of 4 would produce four patterns on top of each other, followed by four more patterns on top of each other.
	- When `tick_mode` is set to a truthy value, the numbers in `durationPattern` represent the number of ticks to last, rather than a whole-note divisions. 1 tick = 1/256th note. This allows for durations smaller and larger than the valid duration values for when `tick_mode` is set to false.
	- When `tick_mode` is set to false or excluded from the command, the following values are the only valid `durationPattern` argument values:
	```javascript
		1: whole note
		2: half note
		d2: dotted half note
		dd2: double dotted half note
		4: quarter note
		4t: quarter triplet note
		d4: dotted quarter note
		dd4: double dotted quarter note
		8: eighth note
		8t: eighth triplet note
		d8: dotted eighth note
		dd8: double dotted eighth note
		16: sixteenth note
		16t: sixteenth triplet note
		32: thirty-second note
		64: sixty-fourth note
	```
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(64).scale(20,90).key('c major').savemidi(ts(),64,16).once();  // 64 random notes in c major at 64 velocity, each lasting a 16th note`
		- `$('example').noise(64).scale(20,90).key('c major').savemidi(ts(),_.noise(64).scale(1,100),4,1,true).once(); // 64 random notes in c major, each with a random velocity between 1 - 100, each lasting 4 ticks`
		- `$('example').iter(8,()=>{this.append(_.sine(choose([1,2,3,4])).size(128).scale(ri(30,50),ri(60,90)).key('c major'))}).savemidi(ts(),64,16,8).once(); // 8 sine wave patterns playing notes in c major, superposed on top of each other. try changing the wraps argument to values other than 8`
---
- **savemidi2d()** (_midifilename_ = Date.now(), _velocityPattern_ = 64, _durationPattern_ = 16, _tick_mode_ = false_, min_note = 0, max_note = 127)
	- creates a MIDI file of MIDI notes named `midifilename` in the `midi` directory, with the FacetPattern's data, assuming that the data was created using the 2d methods for image generation and processing. All nonzero "pixel" values will be translated into a MIDI note. Go to the [methods for image generation and processing](#methods-for-image-generation-and-processing) section for more details on these methods.
	- `VelocityPattern` and `DurationPattern` will automatically scale to match the note pattern. This allows you to modulate MIDI velocity and duration over the course of the whole note.
	- The `velocityPattern` expects values between 1 and 100. (This range is set by the midi-writer-js npm package).
	- The `min_note` and `max_note` values control the range of notes that the corresponding 2d pattern will be generated between.
	- When `tick_mode` is set to a truthy value, the numbers in `durationPattern` represent the number of ticks to last, rather than a whole-note divisions. 1 tick = 1/256th note. This allows for durations smaller and larger than the valid duration values for when `tick_mode` is set to false.
	- When `tick_mode` is set to false or excluded from the command, the following values are the only valid `durationPattern` argument values:
	```javascript
		1: whole note
		2: half note
		d2: dotted half note
		dd2: double dotted half note
		4: quarter note
		4t: quarter triplet note
		d4: dotted quarter note
		dd4: double dotted quarter note
		8: eighth note
		8t: eighth triplet note
		d8: dotted eighth note
		dd8: double dotted eighth note
		16: sixteenth note
		16t: sixteenth triplet note
		32: thirty-second note
		64: sixty-fourth note
	```
	- example:
		- `$('example').silence(2500).iter(8,()=>{this.tri2d(ri(0,49),ri(0,49),ri(0,49),ri(0,49),ri(0,49),ri(0,49),1,0)}).savemidi2d(ts(), 64, 16).once(); // 8 randomly sized triangles in 2d space, all at velocity 64, 16th note durations`
		- `$('example').silence(2500).iter(10,()=>{this.circle2d(ri(10,40), ri(10,40), 10, 1, 0)}).savemidi2d(ts(), 64, 64).once(); // 10 randomly sized circles in 2d space, all at velocity 64, 64th note durations`

### Methods for controlling time
- **bpm** ( _bpm_pattern_ )
	- stores the data of `bpm_pattern` in the transport as BPM values to be cycled through over each loop.
	- the minimum BPM value is 1, and the maximum BPM value is 10000.
	- using the `over()` method on the `bpm_pattern` will cycle through the BPM pattern over multiple loops.
	- example:
		- `$('example').bpm(_.from([20,40,80,160,320]).shuffle()); // each loop will be all 5 of these BPM, randomly ordered`
		- `$('example').bpm(_.ramp(20,200,64).over(4)); // ramps from 20BPM to 200BPM over 4 loops`
---
- **time** ( _time_signature_numerator_pattern_ = 4, _time_signature_denominator_pattern_ = 4 )
	- sets the time signature for the transport.
	- if `time_signature_numerator_pattern` or `time_signature_denominator_pattern` has more than one value, those values will be cycled through over each loop.
	- using the `over()` method on `time_signature_numerator_pattern` or `time_signature_denominator_pattern` will cycle through the time signature pattern over multiple loops.
	- the minimum `_time_signature_numerator_pattern_` value is 1, and the maximum is 32.
	- the minimum `_time_signature_denominator_pattern_` value is 1, and the maximum is 16.
	- example:
		- `$('example').time(4,4); // set time to 4/4`
		- `$('example').time(_.ramp(8,1,8).over(8),2); // ramps from 8/2 to 1/2 time over 8 loops`

### Methods for controlling pattern regeneration
- **whenmod** ( _modulo_operand_, _equals_value_ = 0 )
    - only regenerates the pattern when the number of bars elapsed, modulo the `modulo_operand`, equals the `equals_value` argument. This can be useful when you want to conditionally skip certain commands, only rerunning every n bars.
        - example:
        - `$('example_0').sine(ri(100,400)).whenmod(4, 0); // regenerates the pattern once every 4 bars`
		- `$('example_2').sine(ri(100,400)).whenmod(4, 2); // regenerates the pattern once every 4 bars, but 2 bars away from the above example`
---
- **keep** (  )
	- preserve the generated FacetPattern so that it plays each loop. Without including `keep()`, the FacetPattern will regenerate each loop by default.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(ri(10,500)).keep().play();`
---
- **once** (  )
	- only play the generated FacetPattern a single time. Without including `once()`, the FacetPattern will regenerate and play back each loop by default.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(4096).play().once();`
---
- **over** ( _n_loops_ = 1 )
	- distributes all the events that a FacetPattern would fire over `n_loops` so the pattern can last any number of loops before regenerating.
	- works with audio playback, MIDI note/cc/pitchbend, OSC, BPM (via `.bpm()`), and time signature (via `.time()`).
	- example:
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').play(_.ramp(0,1,16)).over(ri(1,4)); // random sample played 16 times over 1,2,3 or 4 bars`
		- `$('example').drunk(2048,0.01).cc().over(128); // drunk walk over 128 bars, creates a drifty process that you can map onto device paramters to slowly randomize something`

### Methods for setting variables
These can be useful when you want to access or modify the same pattern across commands or inside of one command.

- **set** ( _name_ )
	- saves a FacetPattern's data in memory, for reference as a variable in operations. Any FacetPatterns stored via `.set()` will only be stored until the server is closed.
	- if a pattern stored with `set()` has more than one piece of data in it, the corresponding variable will be an array. If the pattern has one piece of data in it, the corresponding variable will be a float.
	- **NOTE**: when you run the `.set()` command for the first time after starting the system, if you're also running commands that reference that variable in the same block, for the first evaluation, the variable will have a value of 0 as it has not fully propagated into the variable storage system.
		- example:
		```javascript
		$('set_example').noise(8).scale(0,1).set('my_var').once(); // first, set the variable here

		$('example').sine(100).times(my_var).play(); // now, you can use my_var in commands
		```
---
- **drift** ( _seedPattern_, _patternName_, _command_ = function )
	- creates and runs a drifting process on a pattern.
	- when the command is executed manually by the user, it will create and store (internally, via `set()`) a new pattern, named `patternName`, using `seedPattern`.
	- each time the command reruns, it checks if a pattern named `patternName` has been stored. If so, it will modify and replace the saved pattern based on the code in `command`.
	- example:
		- `$('example').drift(_.noise(16).scale(36,72).sort(),'mynotes',()=>{this.walk(0.1,1)}).note(); // starts as ascending melody and drifts away into randomness`
---
- **inc** ( _name_, _amount_to_add_ = 1 )
	- increments a variable called `name` by `amount_to_add`. This variable can be used in operations.
	- similar to the `set()` method, when you run the `.inc()` command for the first time after starting the system, if you're also running commands that reference that variable in the same block, for the first evaluation, the variable will have a value of 0 as it has not fully propagated into the variable storage system.
	- example:
		`$('example').inc('abc').iter(abc,()=>{this.sup(_.randsamp('808'),i/iters)}).play(); // more 808 samples each iteration`
---
- **dec** ( _name_, _amount_to_subtract_ = 1 )
	- decrements a variable called `name` by `amount_to_add`. This variable can be used in operations.
	- similar to the `set()` method, when you run the `.dec()` command for the first time after starting the system, if you're also running commands that reference that variable in the same block, for the first evaluation, the variable will have a value of 0 as it has not fully propagated into the variable storage system.
	- example:
		`$('example').from(8).set('abc').sometimes(0.5,()=>{this.dec('abc')}).sometimes(0.5,()=>{this.inc('abc')}).iter(abc,()=>{this.sup(_.randsamp('k'),i/iters)}).play(); // start at 8, sometimes increment & sometimes decrement the total number of 808 samples`
---
- **setlocal** ( _name_ )
	- saves a FacetPattern's data locally, making it immediately accessible to later operations in the same command.
	- in order to acesss a pattern saved with `setlocal()`, use `getlocal()`.
	- **NOTE**: the data is available only internally, to the command where it runs and cannot be accessed in other commands.
	- example:
		- `$('example').drunk(1000,0.2).setlocal('mylocalpattern').reduce(0).iter(1000,()=>{this.append(_.getlocal('mylocalpattern').jam(0.1,0.1).setlocal('mylocalpattern'))}).saveimg().once(); // initial 1000-value drunk walk, each row 10% of the pixels are +/- 10% modified from previous row`
----
- **getlocal** ( _name_ )
	- retrieves a FacetPattern's data that was stored locally via `setlocal()`.
	- example:
		- `$('example').drunk(1000,0.2).setlocal('mylocalpattern').reduce(0).iter(1000,()=>{this.append(_.getlocal('mylocalpattern').jam(0.1,0.1).setlocal('mylocalpattern'))}).saveimg().once(); // initial 1000-value drunk walk, each row 10% of the pixels are +/- 10% modified from previous row`


### Utility functions
- **barmod** ( _modulo_, _values_ )
	- returns values that depend on the current value of `bars`. (`bars` is a global variable that starts at 0 and increments at the completion of a loop.)
	- selects a value from the `values` array, based on `bars % modulo`.  If the `bars` value currently is 9, and the `modulo` argument to this method is 4, since 9 % 4 = 1, this method will return the value from the `values` array immediately following the number 1.
	- **NOTE**: It first checks if the `values` array contains an even number of elements. If not, it throws an error.
	- **NOTE**: It also checks if every integer from 0 to (mod-1) is one of the even-numbered keys of the values array. If not, it throws an error.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(barmod(4,[0,100,1,150,2,200,3,300])).play(); // when bars % 4 == 0, plays a 100Hz sine. when bars % 4 == 1, plays a 150 Hz sine. when bars % 4 == 2, plays a 200Hz sine. when bars % 4 == 3, plays a 300Hz sine.`
---
- **choose** ( _pattern_ )
	- returns a randomly selected value from a supplied array.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(choose([10,200,1000])).play(); // sine wave with either 10, 200, or 1000 cycles`
---
- **cof** ( _index_ )
	- returns the element at position `index` in the circle of fifths, starting with C and ending with F.
	- the set of notes: `['C', 'G', 'D', 'A', 'E', 'B', 'F#', 'C#', 'G#', 'D#', 'A#', 'F']`.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(16).scale(36,90).key(cof(2)).note(); // MIDI notes in D major`
		- `$('example').noise(16).scale(36,90).key(cof(ri(0,11))).note(); // MIDI notes in random major key`
---
- **decide** ()
	- returns a 1 or 0 randomly.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(choose([10,200,1000])).dup(decide()).play(); // duplicate half the time`
---
- **ftom** ( _hzfrequency_ )
	- converts the supplied `hzfrequency` value to its corresponding MIDI note number.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(220).times(_.sine(ftom(ri(400,1200)))).play(); // 220Hz sine wave (A) multplied by a chromatically related higher sine wave`
- **ms** ( _milliseconds_ )
	- converts the supplied `milliseconds` value to that many samples, at whatever sample rate the user has configured.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(4096).size(ms(5)).play(); // 5ms noise`
		- `$('example').noise(4096).size(ms(50)).play(); // 50ms noise`
---
- **mtof** ( _midi_note_number_ )
	- converts the supplied `midi_note_number` value to its corresponding frequency in Hz.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(mtof(choose([36,38,40,41,43,45,47,48]))).play(); // random sine wave each loop in C major key`
---
- **mtos** ( _midi_note_number_ )
	- converts the supplied `midi_note_number` value to its corresponding number of samples.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(n4).delay(mtos(choose([36,38,40,41,43,45,47,48]))).delay(mtos(choose([36,38,40,41,43,45,47,48]))).delay(mtos(choose([36,38,40,41,43,45,47,48]))).play(); // noise is delayed by amounts that are harmonic with C major key`
---
- **random** ( _min_ = 0, _max_ = 1, _int_mode_ = 0, _weight = 1_ )
	- returns a random number between `min` and `max`. If `int_mode` = 1, returns an integer. Otherwise, returns a float by default.
	- you can also use these shorthands for a random float: `rf(min,max)` and a random integer: `ri(min,max)`.
	-  The `weight` argument allows you to specify an exponential weight for the probability of random values. For instance, `rf(0.125,8,3)` will generate half of its values between 0.125 and 1; and the other half will be between 1 and 8. By default, the weighting is linear, i.e. all values between `min` and `max` have equal probability.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(ri(1,1000)).play(); // a sine wave with 1 - 1000 cycles`
---
- **ts** ( )
	- returns the current timestamp Date.now() as a string.
	- `$('example').sine(100,n1).saveas('mytest'+ts()).once(); // saves a file in the samples directory named like this: mytest1704420621454.wav`
---
- **just** ()
    - returns an array of frequency ratios for the just intonation tuning system.
    - example:
        - `$('example').sine(100,n16).play(_.ramp(0,1,12),_.from(just())); // sine waves in ascending just intonation scale`
---
- **pythagorean** ()
    - returns an array of frequency ratios for the Pythagorean tuning system.

---
- **equaltemp** ()
    - returns an array of frequency ratios for the 12-tone equal temperament tuning system.
    - example:
        - `$('example').sine(100,n16).play(_.ramp(0,1,12),_.from(equaltemp())); // sine waves in ascending equal temperament intonation scale`
---

    - returns an array of frequency ratios for the 19-tone equal division of the octave (EDO) tuning system.
    - example:
        - `$('example').sine(100,n16).play(_.ramp(0,1,12),_.from(edo19())); // sine waves in ascending edo19 intonation scale`
---
- **edo31** ()
    - returns an array of frequency ratios for the 31-tone equal division of the octave (EDO) tuning system.
    - example:
        - `$('example').sine(100,n16).play(_.ramp(0,1,12),_.from(edo31())); // sine waves in ascending edo31 intonation scale`

### Methods for controlling MIDI scales
- **randscale** ( )
	- returns a random scale for MIDI notes out. The set of possible scales is listed in the `key()` method.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(32).scale(30,80).sort().key('f#', randscale()).note(); // random scale in f#`

### FacetPattern generators that can take a FacetPattern, number, array, or object as an argument
When a generator takes a FacetPattern or an array as an argument, it uses that pattern to dynamically change its behavior over time, affecting the output in a more complex way than if a single number were supplied. For example, with the command `$('example').sine(440).play();`, the output is a static 440Hz wave. But with the command `$('example').sine(_.sine(5).scale(20,2000))).play();`, the frequency of the sine wave is being modulated by a 5 Hz sine wave which is generating values between 20 and 2000. This produces a classic frequency modulation sound, but since you can supply any FacetPattern as an argument, there are lots of sound design possibilities.

- **sine** ( _frequencyPattern_, _duration_ = sample_rate, _samplerate_ = sample_rate, _fade_in_and_out_ = true )
	- generates a sine wave at `frequencyPattern` Hertz, lasting for `duration` samples, at the sample rate defined by `samplerate`.
	- output range is from -1 - 1.
	- by default, the `fade_in_and_out` argument is set to true. This will cause the first 30 milliseconds to be faded in an out, to avoid audible clicks. Using a non-truthy value for `fade_in_and_out` will generate the signal without applying any fade.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(440,n4).play(); // 440 Hz sine wave for a quarter note`
		- `$('example').sine(_.ramp(10,2000,300)).play(); // ramp from 10Hz to 2000 Hz over 300 values`
		- `$('example').sine(_.sine(5).scale(20,2000)).play(); // 5Hz frequency modulation with output frequencies oscillating between 20Hz and 2000Hz`
---
- **cosine** ( _frequencyPattern_, _duration_ = 1 second, _samplerate_ = default_sample_rate, _fade_in_and_out_ = true )
	- generates a cosine wave at `frequencyPattern` Hertz, lasting for `duration` samples, at the sample rate defined by `samplerate`.
	- output range is from -1 - 1.
	- by default, the `fade_in_and_out` argument is set to true. This will cause the first 30 milliseconds to be faded in an out, to avoid audible clicks. Using a non-truthy value for `fade_in_and_out` will generate the signal without applying any fade.
	- example:
		- `$('example').cosine(440,n4).play(); // 440 Hz cosine wave for a quarter note`
		- `$('example').cosine(_.ramp(10,2000,300)).play(); // ramp from 10Hz to 2000 Hz over 300 values`
		- `$('example').cosine(_.cosine(5).scale(20,2000)).play(); // 5Hz frequency modulation with output frequencies oscillating between 20Hz and 2000Hz`
---
- **circle** ( _frequencyPattern_, _duration_ = 1 second, _samplerate_ = default_sample_rate )
	- generates a half-circle wave at `frequencyPattern` Hertz, lasting for `duration` samples, at the sample rate defined by `samplerate`.
	- output range is from 0 - 1.
	- example:
		- `$('example').circle(440,n4).play(); // 440 Hz cosine wave for a quarter note`
		- `$('example').noise(n1).times(_.circle(4)).play().once(); // amplitude modulation of noise with a quarter note circular waveform`
		- `$('example').noise(n1).ffilter(_.circle(1).invert().size(128).scale(0, NYQUIST/2),_.circle(1).size(128).scale(NYQUIST / 2, NYQUIST)).play().once(); // circular spectral filtering of a whole note of noise`
---
- **markov** ( _states_ = [{name, value, probs}, {name, value, probs}, ...] )
    - modifies the input FacetPattern according to a Markov chain. The `states` parameter is an array where each entry is an object representing a state. Each state object has a `name`, a `value` that corresponds to a value in `this.data`, and a `probs` object that defines the transition probabilities to other states.
    - The method modifies `this.data` by transitioning each value to a new state based on the probabilities defined in the `states` array. The transition probabilities are normalized so that they add up to 1 for each state.
    - Example: 
    ```javascript
    $('example')
  .iter(choose([3,4,8]), () => {
    this.prepend(_.from(['k*', 'h*', 's*', 'h*', '_', '_','_', '_'])
      .markov([{
          name: "state1",
          value: 'k*',
          probs: {
            "state1": 0.8,
            "state2": 0.5,
            "state3": 0.5
          }
        },
        {
          name: "state2",
          value: 'h*',
          probs: {
            "state3": 1
          }
        },
        {
          name: "state3",
          value: 's*',
          probs: {
            "state1": 1
          }
        },
		{
          name: "state4",
          value: '_',
          probs: {
            "state1": 0.5,
			"state4": 0.5
          }
        }
      ]))
  })
  .run(() => {
    this.seq(this.data)
  }).play();
  ```
---
- **phasor** ( _frequencyPattern_, _duration_ = 1 second, _samplerate_ = default_sample_rate, _fade_in_and_out_ = true )
	- generates a phasor wave at `frequencyPattern` Hertz, lasting for `duration` samples, at the sample rate defined by `samplerate`.
	- output range is from -1 - 1.
	- by default, the `fade_in_and_out` argument is set to true. This will cause the first 30 milliseconds to be faded in an out, to avoid audible clicks. Using a non-truthy value for `fade_in_and_out` will generate the signal without applying any fade.
	- example:
		- `$('example').phasor(440,n4).play(); // 440 Hz phasor wave for a quarter note`
		- `$('example').phasor(_.ramp(10,2000,300)).play(); // ramp from 10Hz to 2000 Hz over 300 values`
		- `$('example').phasor(_.phasor(5).scale(20,2000)).play(); // 5Hz frequency modulation with output frequencies oscillating between 20Hz and 2000Hz`
---
- **pluck** ( _frequency_, _damping_ = 0, _feedback_ = 0.5 )
	- generates a Karplus-Strong type string pluck emulation at `frequency` Hertz. `damping` and `feedback` values should be between 0 and 1.
	- output range is from -1 - 1.
	- example:
		- `$('example').pluck(440,n4,rf(),rf()).play(); // different 440 Hz quarter note pluck each time`
---
- **rect** ( _frequencyPattern_, _duration_ = 1 second, _pulse_width_ = 0.5, _samplerate_ = default_sample_rate, _fade_in_and_out_ = true )
	- generates a rectangle wave at `frequencyPattern` Hertz, with a pulse width defined by `pulse_width`,  lasting for `duration` samples, at the sample rate defined by `samplerate`.
	- output range is from -1 - 1.
	- by default, the `fade_in_and_out` argument is set to true. This will cause the first 30 milliseconds to be faded in an out, to avoid audible clicks. Using a non-truthy value for `fade_in_and_out` will generate the signal without applying any fade.
	- example:
		- `$('example').rect(440,n4,rf()).play(); // 440 Hz rectangle wave for a quarter note, different bandwidth each time`
		- `$('example').rect(_.ramp(10,2000,300)).play(); // ramp from 10Hz to 2000 Hz over 300 values`
		- `$('example').rect(_.rect(5).scale(20,2000)).play(); // 5Hz frequency modulation with output frequencies oscillating between 20Hz and 2000Hz`
---
- **square** ( _frequencyPattern_, _duration_ = sample_rate, _samplerate_ = sample_rate )
	- generates a square wave at `frequencyPattern` Hertz, lasting for `duration` samples, at the sample rate defined by `samplerate`.
	- output range is from -1 - 1.
	- example:
		- `$('example').square(440,n4).play(); // 440 Hz square wave for a quarter note`
		- `$('example').square(_.ramp(10,2000,300)).play(); // ramp from 10Hz to 2000 Hz over 300 values`
		- `$('example').square(_.square(5).scale(20,2000)).play(); // 5Hz frequency modulation with output frequencies oscillating between 20Hz and 2000Hz`
---
- **tri** ( _frequencyPattern_, _duration_ = sample_rate, _samplerate_ = sample_rate, _fade_in_and_out_ = true )
	- generates a triangle wave at `frequencyPattern` Hertz, lasting for `duration` samples, at the sample rate defined by `samplerate`.
	- output range is from -1 - 1.
	- by default, the `fade_in_and_out` argument is set to true. This will cause the first 30 milliseconds to be faded in an out, to avoid audible clicks. Using a non-truthy value for `fade_in_and_out` will generate the signal without applying any fade.
	- example:
		- `$('example').tri(440,n4).play(); // 440 Hz triangle wave for a quarter note`
		- `$('example').tri(_.ramp(10,2000,300)).play(); // ramp from 10Hz to 2000 Hz over 300 values`
		- `$('example').tri(_.tri(5).scale(20,2000)).play(); // 5Hz frequency modulation with output frequencies oscillating between 20Hz and 2000Hz`

### FacetPattern generators
- **binary** ( _integer_, _length_)
	- Computes the binary representation of `integer`. If `length` is not present, the output FacetPattern will be the actual length of the binary representation of `integer`.
	- output range is from 0 - 1.
	- example:
		- `$('example').binary(8); // 1000`
		- `$('example').binary(490321,13); // 1110111101101: truncated at 13 values`
		- `$('example').binary(8,12); // 000000001000: padded with 0s`
---
- **dirsamp** ( _dir_ = `../samples/`, _dir_pos_, _channel_index_ = 0 )
	- loads a wav file from the `dir` directory into memory, based on its alphabetical position. The position is determined by the `dir_pos` argument, which should be a float between 0 and 1. A `dir_pos` value of 0 would load the first wav file in alphabetical order, a `dir_pos` value of 0.5 would load the middle file, and so on.
	- The default directory is `../samples/`, but you can supply any directory as an argument.
	- By default, it loads the first channel (`channel_index` = 0) but you can specify any channel to load.
	- __Note__: this example uses MacOS / Linux file paths with forward slashes (e.g. `my/path/here`). For Windows, you will need to use back slashes (e.g `my\path\here`)
	- example:
		- `$('example').iter(8,()=>{this.sup(_.dirsamp('808',i/iters),i/iters)}).play(); // 808 sequence`
---
- **drunk** ( _length_, _intensity_, _starting_value_ = Math.random() )
	- generates a random walk of values between 0 and 1 for `length` values, starting at `starting_value` which is a random value between 0 and 1 by default. `intensity` controls how much to add.
	- output range is from 0 - 1.
	- example:
		- `$('example').drunk(16,0.1); // slight random movement`
---
- **envelope** ( _values_ )
	- Generates an envelope using the supplied array `values`, which must have a total number of entries equal to a multiple of 3. The numbers inside the `values` array should be continually ordered in groups of three: `from`, `to`, `size`, just like the `ramp()` method.
	- example:
		- ` $('example').noise(ms(500)).times(_.envelope([0,1,ms(10),1,0.1,ms(200),0.1,0,ms(290)])).play(); // transient noise burst`
---
- **euclid** ( _pulses_, _steps_ )
	- generates a Euclidean sequence with `pulses` pulses over `steps` steps.
	- output range is from 0 - 1.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(100).times(_.euclid(4,8)).play(); // gating a sine wave with a euclidean sequence`
---
- **file** ( _filepath_ )
	- loads the raw data of any file into memory. You can supply any file type.
	- output range is from -1 - 1.
	- By default, it checks for a file in the `files` subdirectory. If no file exists there, it will try to load the file as an absolute path on your hard drive. 
	- __Note__: this example uses MacOS / Linux file paths with forward slashes (e.g. `my/path/here`). For Windows, you will need to use back slashes (e.g `my\path\here`)
	- example:
		- `$('example').file('my_image.png').play(); // if my_image.png is in the files directory, this will play the file's raw data. NOTE: this could be very noisy!`
		- `$('example').file('/Users/my_username/Desktop/myfile.zip').play(); // example with a supplied absolute file path`
---
- **from** ( _pattern_ )
	- allows the user to specify their own pattern. **Note the array syntax!**
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([1,2,3,4]);`
---
- **image** ( _filepath_, _columnsPerSecond_ = 512, _minimumFrequency_ = 20, _maximumFrequency_ = sample_rate / 2, _frequencyPattern_ )
	- transposes an image into audio by superposing sine waves across the audio spectrum, with one sine wave for each row of pixels in the image. The amplitudes of each sine wave are modulated by the corresponding brightness of each pixel in the image, producing an analog of the image in the audio spectrum.
	- the lowest pixels in the image correspond to the lowest frequencies in the output, and the highest pixels in the image correspond to the highest frequencies in the output.
	- the default `columnsPerSecond` value of 512 means that each second of audio will contain 512 columns of pixels. This value can be larger or smaller, but keep in mind that as this value decreases, the file will take more time to generate. This method can be CPU intensive and works best with smaller image files or larger `columnsPerSecond values`.
	- since pixel brightness corresponds with loudness, images with dark backgrounds and high contrast will produce clearer tones.
	- This method currently only works with PNG files.
	- the `minimumFrequency` and `maximumFrequency` values control the range of frequencies that the pixels will map onto.
	- the `frequencyPattern` argument allows you to remap the rows of pixels with a FacetPattern. It should be scaled between 0 and 1. It will automatically be resized so its data length matches the height of the image in pixels. Lower values in `frequencyPattern` will map onto lower frequencies inside the range of `minimumFrequency` and `maximumFrequency`. Higher values in `frequencyPattern` will map onto higher frequencies inside the range of `minimumFrequency` and `maximumFrequency`.
	- output range is from -1 - 1.
	- __Note__: this example uses MacOS / Linux file paths with forward slashes (e.g. `my/path/here`). For Windows, you will need to use back slashes (e.g `my\path\here`)
	- example:
		- `$('example').image('/path/to/file/goes/here.png',1024).play(); // each column lasts 1024 samples`
---
- **noise** ( _length_ )
	- generates a random series of values between -1 and 1 for `length`.
	- example:

---
- **primes** ( _n_, _offset_from_first_prime_ = 2, _skip_ = 1 )
	- generates the first `n` prime numbers starting at `offset`, skipping `skip` prime numbers before including the next one in the list.
	- `n` specifies the number of prime numbers to generate.
	- `offset` specifies the first number to be included in the list of prime numbers. The default value is 2.
	- `skip` specifies the number of prime numbers to skip before including the next one in the list. The default value is 1.
	- example:
		- `$('s').noise(n4).times(_.ramp(1,0,n4)).iter(12,()=>{this.allpass().delay(_.primes(60,1000,ri(20,2000)).data[i]).full()}).full().play(); // generates a quarter note transient burst of noise, then iteratively sends it through delays that are all primes`
- **ramp** ( _from_, _to_, _size_ = 128 )
	- moves from `from` to `to` over `size` values.
	- example:
		- `$('example').ramp(250,100,1000); // go from 250 to 100 over 1000 values`
---
- **randfile** ( _dir_ = `../files/` )
	- loads a random file from the `files` directory into memory. The default directory is `../files/`, but you can supply any directory as an argument.
	- output range is from -1 - 1.
	- __Note__: this example uses MacOS / Linux file paths with forward slashes (e.g. `my/path/here`). For Windows, you will need to use back slashes (e.g `my\path\here`)
	- example:
		- `$('example').randfile().play(); // random new file converted to audio every time`
---
- **randsamp** ( _dir_ = `../samples/` _channel_index_ = 0 )
	- loads a random wav file from the `dir` directory into memory. The default directory is `../samples/`, but you can supply any directory as an argument.
	- By default, it loads the first channel (`channel_index` = 0) but you can specify any channel to load.
	- __Note__: this example uses MacOS / Linux file paths with forward slashes (e.g. `my/path/here`). For Windows, you will need to use back slashes (e.g `my\path\here`)
	- example:
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').reverse().play(); // random backwards sample`
---
- **sample** ( _filepath_, _channel_index_ = 0)
	- loads a wav file from the `samples/` directory into memory. You can also specify any file with an absolute file path. The `.wav` can be omitted from _filename_; in this case `.wav` it will be automatically appended to _filename_. By default, it loads the first channel (`channel_index` = 0) but you can specify any channel to load.
	- __Note__: this example uses MacOS / Linux file paths with forward slashes (e.g. `my/path/here`). For Windows, you will need to use back slashes (e.g `my\path\here`)
	- example:
		- `$('example').sample('1234').play(); // if 1234.wav is in the samples directory, you're good to go`
		- `$('example').sample('./myfolder/myfile.wav'); // or point to the file with a relative path`
---
- **silence** ( _length_ )
	- generates silence (many 0s in a row) for `length` samples.
	- example:
		- `$('example').silence(n2).append(_.noise(n2)).play(); // first half of loop is silence; second half is noise`
---
- **spiral** ( _length_, _degrees_ = 360/length, _angle_phase_offset_ = 0 )
	- generates a spiral of length `length` of continually ascending values in a circular loop between 0 and 1, where each value is `degrees` away from the previous value. `degrees` can be any number between 0 and 360. By default `degrees` is set to `360/length` which produces an output pattern similar to branching leaves, where each value is as far away as possible from the previous value.
	- The `angle_phase_offset` argument changes where the sequence starts. At its default value of 0, the first value will be 0. You can supply any float between 0 and 1, and the sequence will begin at that value instead.
	- output range is from 0 - 1.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(1).times(_.spiral(1000,ri(1,360))).play(); // an interesting, modulated sine wave`
---
- **turing** ( _length_ )
	- generates a pattern of length `length` with random 1s and 0s.
	- example:
		- `$('example').turing(64); // instant rhythmic triggers`

### FacetPattern modulators
- **abs** ( )
	- returns the absolute value of all numbers in the FacetPattern.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(100).add(-0.3).abs().play(); // a wonky sine`
---
- **allpass** ( _frequency_ = default_sample_rate/2 )
 	- runs the FacetPattern through an allpass filter.
	- `frequency` changes the amount of phase shift introduced by the filter at different frequencies. It will change the phase response of the filter while leaving the magnitude response unchanged.
 	- example:
 		- `$('example').randsamp('808').iter(12,()=>{this.allpass().delay(ri(1,6000))}).scale(-1,1).play(); // reverb`
 ---
- **at** ( _position_, _value_ )
	- replaces the value of a FacetPattern at the relative position `position` with `value`.
	- example:
		- `$('example').turing(16).at(0,1); // the 1st value of the 16-step Turing sequence (i.e. 0% position) is always 1`
		- `$('example').turing(16).at(0.5,2); // the 9th value of the 16-step Turing sequence (i.e. 50% position) is always 2`
---
- **audio** ( )
	- removes any DC offset on the FacetPattern by running it through a high-pass biquadratic filter at 5Hz.
	- example:
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').times(_.noise(4)).audio().play();`
---
- **bitshift** ( _shift_ = 16 )
	- performs a bitwise rotation on the elements of the FacetPattern objectâ€™s data array by shift bits.
	- `shift` is an optional parameter that specifies the number of bits to rotate. It defaults to 16 if not provided. The value of shift is converted to a non-negative integer and taken modulo 32 before being used.
	- The method first scales the values in the data array to a range of 0 to 1000000 and rounds them to integers. It then performs a bitwise rotation on each element using a combination of the left shift (<<) and right shift (>>>) operators. Finally, it restores the original scale of the data.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(1000,n2).bitshift(16).play(); // rotates the bits of a 1000Hz sine wave by 16 positions`
---
- **changed** ( )
	- returns a 1 or 0 for each value in the FacetPattern. If the value is different than the previous value, returns a 1. Otherwise returns a 0. (The first value is compared against the last value in the FacetPattern.)
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([1,1,3,4]).changed(); // 1 0 1 1`
---
- **clip** ( _min_, _max_ )
	- clips any numbers in the FacetPattern to a `min` and `max` range.
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([1,2,3,4]).clip(2,3); // 2 2 3 3 `
---
- **compress** ( _ratio_, _threshold_, _attackTime_, _releaseTime_ )
	- compresses the FacetPattern into a smaller dynamic range. `ratio` is a float between 0 and 1 corresponding to n:1 so 0.5 would be 2:1, 0.2 would be 5:1, etc. `threshold` is the sample amplitude at which compression kicks in. `attackTime` and `releaseTime` are expressed as relations to a second, so 0.1 would be 1/10th of a second.
	- example:
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').compress(0.1,0.001,0.01,0.01).play();`
---
- **crab** ( )
	- superposes a reversed copy of the FacetPattern on top of iself, so it plays backwards and forwards at the same time..
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(_.ramp(20,2000,1000)).crab().full().play(); // sine wave ramps from 20Hz to 2000Hz both backwards and forwards at the same time`
---
- **curve** ( _tension_ = 0.5, _segments_ = 25 )
	- returns a curved version of the FacetPattern. Tension and number of segments in the curve can be included but default to 0.5 and 25, respectively.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(16).curve();				// not so noisy`
		- `$('example').noise(16).curve(0.5, 10);		// fewer segments per curve`
		- `$('example').noise(16).curve(0.9);			// different curve type`
---
- **distavg** ( )
	- computes the distance from the average of the FacetPattern, for each element in the FacetPattern.
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([0.1,4,3.14]).distavg(); // -2.3133 1.5867 0.7267`
---
- **dup** ( _num_ )
	- duplicates the FacetPattern `num` times.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(n16).dup(ri(2,12)).play(); // 16th note of noise repeats between 2 and 12 times each loop `
---
- **echo** ( _num_, _feedback_ = 0.666 )
	- repeats the FacetPattern `num` times, with amplitude multiplied by `feedback` each repeat.
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([1]).echo(5); // 1 0.666 0.4435 0.29540 0.19674 0.13103`
		- `$('example').phasor(50).size(n8).echo(7).play(); // echoing out over a whole note `
---
- **expo** ( _exponent_ )
	- applies exponential scaling to the FacetPattern based on its minimum and maximum. `exponent` values larger than 1 will emphasize lower numbers more and more. Values less than 1 will emphasize higher numbers more and more.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(_.ramp(100,2000,512).expo(6),n1).play().once(); // experiment with different expo() values to hear the difference`
---
- **fade** ( _fade_percent_ = 0.1 )
	- applies a crossfade window to the FacetPattern, where `fade_percent` of the beginning and end are faded in/out.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(1024).fade().play();`
---
- **fadein** ( _fade_percent_ = 0.5 )
	- applies a fade to the beginning of the FacetPattern, where `fade_percent` of the beginning is faded in.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(20000).fadein().play();`
---
- **fadeout** ( _fade_percent_ = 0.5 )
	- applies a fade to the ending 50% of the FacetPattern, where `fade_percent` of the beginning is faded out.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(20000).fadeout().play();`
---
- **fkey** ( _MIDI_note_scale_, _binThreshold_ = 0.005, _maxHarmonic_ = 10 )
	- applies a spectral gate to the FacetPattern, muting any frequency bins that do not closely map onto a MIDI note frequency included in `MIDI_note_scale`.
	- `binThreshold` controls how close a bin frequency must be to a MIDI note frequency or its harmonic in order to be kept. For example, if `binThreshold` is set to 0.1, then a bin frequency must be within 10% of a MIDI note frequency or its harmonic in order to be kept.
	- `maxHarmonic` controls how many integer harmonics of MIDI notes in `MIDI_note_scale` to include in the output.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(n1).times(_.ramp(1,0,n1)).fkey(_.from([48,50,52,53,55,57,59,60]),0.005,6).play(); // noise spectrally filtered to bins matching C major notes 48,50,52,53,55,57,59,60 and their 6 next harmonics`
---
- **flange** ( _delaySamples_ = 220, _depth_ = 110 )
	- applies a flanger effect to the FacetPattern.
	- `delaySamples` is the base delay in samples. Controls the delay of the flanging effect.
	- `depth` is the maximum amount by which the delay is modulated. Controls the depth of the flanging effect.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(100,n1).flange(220,110).play(); // flanged whole note sine wave at 100Hz`
---
- **flipabove** ( _maximum_ )
	- for all values above `maximum`, it returns `maximum` minus how far above the value was.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(100).flipabove(0.2).play(); // wonky sine`
---
- **flipbelow** ( _min_ )
	- for all values below `minimum`, it returns `minimum` plus how far below the value was.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(100).flipbelow(0.2).play(); // inverse wonky sine`
---
- **follow** ( _attackTime_ = default_sample_rate / 10, _releaseTime_ = default_sample_rate / 4 )
	- performs envelope following on a FacetPattern.
	- `attackTime` is the attack time in samples. It controls the speed at which the envelope rises. Its default value is 100ms.
	- `releaseTime` is the release time in samples. It controls the speed at which the envelope falls. Its default value is 250ms.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(n1).times(_.noise(32).scale(0,1).size(n1).follow(n16,n16)).play(); // controlling the amplitude of a whole note of noise, with 32 samples of noise sent through the envelope follower`
---
- **fracture** ( _pieces_ )
	- divides and scrambles the FacetPattern into `pieces` pieces.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(100).fracture(10).play(); // the sine has shattered into 10 pieces!`
---
- **ftom** ( )
	- converts all values in the FacetPattern from frequency values (Hz) to MIDI note values.
	- example:
		- `$('example').ramp(1000,250,16).ftom(); // 83, 82, 82, 81, 80, 79, 77, 76, 75, 74, 72, 71, 69, 67, 65, 62`
---
- **full** ( )
	- rescales the FacetPattern to a full dynamic range between -1 and 1, without any dynamic range compression, in a more efficient way than `scale(-1,1)`.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(n2).times(0.1).loud().play(); // remove loud() to hear the difference`
---
- **gate** (  _threshold_, _attackSamples_, _releaseSamples_ )
	- gates the incoming FacetPattern so that any values below `threshold`, after `attackSamples` have occurred, will be set to 0, until the values go back above `threshold` for `releaseSamples`. 
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(50).gate(0.1,20,20).play();`
---
- **gt** ( _amt_ )
	- returns `1` for every value in the FacetPattern greater than `amt` and `0` for all other values.

---
- **interp** ( _weight_ = 0.5, _name_ )
	- interpolates the FacetPattern with a FacetPattern. A weight of 0.5 gives equal weight to both patterns.
		- example:
		- `$('example').sine(100).interp(0.5,_.randsamp('808')).play(); // 50% sine wave; 50% random sample`
---
- **invert** ( )
	- computes the `minimum` and `maximum` values in the FacetPattern, then scales every number to the opposite position, relative to `minimum` and `maximum`.
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([0,0.1,0.5,0.667,1]).invert(); // 1 0.9 0.5 0.333 0`
---
- **jam** ( _prob_, _amt_ )
	- changes values in the FacetPattern.  `prob` (float 0-1) sets the likelihood of each value changing. `amt` is how much bigger or smaller the changed values can be. If `amt` is set to 2, and `prob` is set to 0.5 half the values could have any number between 2 and -2 added to them.
	- example:
		- `$('example').drunk(128,0.05).jam(0.1,0.7); // small 128 step random walk with larger deviations from the jam`
---
- **lt** ( _amt_ )
	- returns `1` for every value in the FacetPattern less than `amt` and `0` for all other values.
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7]).lt(0.6); // 1 1 0 0`
---
- **lte** ( _amt_ )
	- returns `1` for every value in the FacetPattern less than or equal to `amt` and `0` for all other values.
	- example:
		- `$('example').from(0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7]).lte(0.5); // 1 1 1 0`
---
- **log** ( _intensity_ , _direction_ )
	- stretches a FacetPattern according to a logarithmic curve, where the values at the end can be stretched for a significant portion of the FacetPattern, and the values at the beginning can be squished together. The intensity of the curve is controlled by `intensity`, which accepts a float between 0 and 1. If `direction` is negative, it returns the FacetPattern in reverse.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(n8).log(rf()).play(); // each time a different logarithmic curve on the 8th note of noise`
---
- **mtof** ( )
	- converts all values in the FacetPattern from MIDI note values to frequency values (Hz).
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([60,55,76,100]).mtof(); // 261.63, 220, 659.26, 2637.02`
---
- **mtos** ( )
	- converts all values in the FacetPattern from MIDI note values to samples.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(n4).comb(_.noise(128).scale(0,127).key('c','major').mtos().sort()).play(); // comb filter delayed by sample values in c major on a quarter note of noise`
---
- **modulo** ( _amt_ )
	- returns the modulo i.e. `% amt` calculation for each value in the FacetPattern.
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([1,2,3,4]).modulo(3); // 1 2 0 1`
---
- **mutechunks** ( _chunks_, _prob_, _yes_fade_ = true )
	- slices the input FacetPattern into `chunks` chunks and mutes `prob` percent of them. __Note__: this is intended for use with FacetPatterns with a large enough amount of data to be played back at audio rate. For a similar effect on smaller FacetPatterns, use `prob()`.
	- The default behavior is for each chunk to be slightly faded in and out to prevent audible clicks, but if you want to run this on smaller chunks of information for control-signal purposes, you can supply a falsy `yes_fade` argument.
	- example:
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').mutechunks(16,0.33).play();	// 33% of 16 audio slices muted`
---
- **normalize** ( )
	- scales the FacetPattern to the 0 - 1 range.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(1).times(4000).normalize(); // the gain is undone!`
		- `$('example').sine(1).scale(-10,10).normalize(); // works with negative values`
---
- **nonzero** ( )
	- replaces all instances of 0 with the previous nonzero value. Useful after with probability controls, which by default will set some values to 0. Chaining a nonzero() after that would replace the 0s with the other values the pattern. Particularly in a MIDI context with .prob(), you probably don't want to send MIDI note values of 0, so this will effectively sample and hold each nonzero value, keeping the MIDI note values in the expected range.
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([1,2,3,4]).prob(0.5).nonzero(); // if 2 and 4 are set to 0 by prob(0.5), the output of .nonzero() would be 1 1 3 3`
---
- **palindrome** ( )
	- returns the original FacetPattern plus the reversed FacetPattern.
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([0,1,2,3]).palindrome(); // 0 1 2 3 3 2 1 0`
---
- **pow** ( _expo_, _direction_ = 1 )
	- stretches a FacetPattern according to an exponential power `expo`, where the values at the beginning can be stretched for a significant portion of the FacetPattern, and the values at the end can be squished together. If `direction` is negative, returns the FacetPattern in reverse.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(100).pow(6.5).play(); // squished into the end`
		- `$('example').sine(100).pow(6.5,-1).play(); // squished at the beginning`
---
- **prob** ( _amt_ )
	- sets some values in the FacetPattern to 0. `prob` (float 0-1) sets the likelihood of each value changing.
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([1,2,3,4]).prob(0.5); // 1 0 3 0 first time it runs`
		- `$('example').from([1,2,3,4]).prob(0.5); // 0 0 3 4 second time it runs`
		- `$('example').from([1,2,3,4]).prob(0.5); // 0 2 3 4 third time it runs`
---
- **quantize** ( _resolution_ )
	- returns `0` for every step in the FacetPattern whose position is not a multiple of `resolution`.
	- example:
		- `$('example').drunk(16,0.5).quantize(4); // 0.5241 0 0 0 0.7420 0 0 0 1.0 0 0 0 0.4268 0 0 0`
---
- **range** ( _new_min_, _new_max_ )
	- returns the subset of the FacetPattern from the relative positions of `new_min` (float 0-1) and `new_max` (float 0-1).
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4]).range(0.5,1); // 0.3 0.4`
---
- **rangesamps** ( _start_, _length_ )
	- returns a subset of the FacetPattern, using a relative `start` position (between 0 - 1) and a total length in samples.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(n1).log(0.9).rangesamps(rf(0,0.875),n8).play(); // plays a different 8th note from the same de-pitched sine wave every time`
		- `$('example').silence(n1).iter(128,()=>{this.sup(_.noise(n64).lpf(_.ramp(250,40,20),50).times(_.ramp(1,0,n64)).rangesamps(rf(),n64).fade(0.1),rf())}).play(); // granular synthesis of 128 synthesized kick drums`
---
- **rechunk** ( _chunks_, _probability_ )
	- slices the input FacetPattern into `chunks` chunks and shuffles the chunks around. The `probability` argument controls the percentage of chunks to reorder, and it expects a float between 0 and 1.
	- The default behavior is for each chunk to be slightly faded in and out to prevent audible clicks, but if you want to run this on smaller chunks of information for control-signal purposes, you can supply a falsy `yes_fade` argument.
	- example:
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').rechunk(16).play();	// 16 slices from the sample in random order`
---
- **reduce** ( _new_size_ )
	- reduces the FacetPattern length to `new_size`. If `new_size` is larger than the FacetPattern length, no change.
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([1,2,3,4]).reduce(2); // 1 3`
---
- **replace** ( _original_value_, _new_value_ )
	- replaces all instances of `original_value` with `new_value` in the FacetPattern.
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([42,0,0,36]).replace(0,-1); // 42,-1,-1,36`
---
- **resonate** ( _baseFrequency_, _coefficients_, _q_ = 80, _wet_ = 1 )
	- resonates the FacetPattern running it through parallel bandpass filters. Each number in the `coefficients` FacetPattern is multiplied by the `baseFrequency` to determine the frequency for that bandpass filter.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(n16).times(_.ramp(1,0,n16)).resonate(mtof(36),_.ramp(1,20,20),80).play(); // 16th note transient noise burst, resonating at its first 20 harmonics starting at 65.41 Hz (MIDI note C2, mtof(36))`
---
- **reverb** (  _size_ = 1, _feedback_ = 0.85 )
	- applies the Schroeder reverb algorithm to the FacetPattern. The `size` argument should be between 0 and 2 for most use cases but can go up to 10.
	- the `feedback` argument controls feedback in the reverb algorithm. It should be between 0 and 0.98.
	- example:
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').reverb(rf()).play(); // different reverb size for random sample each loop`
---
- **reverse** ( )
	- returns the reversed FacetPattern.
	- example:
		- `$('example').ramp(0,1,128).reverse(); // goes from 1 to 0 over 128 values`
---
- **round** (  )
	- rounds all values in the FacetPattern to an integer.
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([0.1,0.5,0.9,1.1]).round(); // 0 1 1 1`
---
- **saheach** ( _n_ )
	- samples and holds every `nth` value in the FacetPattern.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(6).saheach(2); // 0.33173470944031735, 0.33173470944031735, 0.17466890792169742, 0.17466890792169742, 0.5601080880419886,  0.5601080880419886  `
---
- **size** ( _new_size_ )
	- upscales or downscales the FacetPattern prior to playback, so its length is `new_size` samples.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(1000).size(n1).play(); // upscaling 1000 samples of noise to be 1 whole note long`
---
- **scale** ( _new_min_, _new_max_, _exponent_ = 1 )
	- moves the FacetPattern to a new range, from `new_min` to `new_max`, with `exponent` allowing for nonlinear transformations. 
	- `exponent` values larger than 1 will emphasize lower numbers more and more. Values less than 1 will emphasize higher numbers more and more.
	- **NOTE**: this method will return the average of `new_min` and `new_max` if the FacetPattern is only 1 value long. since you cannot interpolate where the value would fall in the new range, without a larger FacetPattern to provide initial context of the value's relative position. This operation works better with sequences larger than 3 or 4.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(10,100).scale(0,1); // unipolar signal`
---
- **shift** ( _amt_ )
	- moves the FacetPattern to the left or the right. `amt` gets wrapped to values between -1 and 1, since you can't shift more than 100% left or 100% right.
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([1,2,3,4]).shift(-0.5); // 3 4 2 1`
---
- **shuffle** ( _prob_ = 1 )
	- randomizes the order of the elements in the FacetPattern.
	- The `prob` argument controls the percentage of data to shuffle. It should be a float between 0 and 1. A `prob` of 1 means 100% of the elements will shuffle; a `prob` of 0.5 means 50% of the elements will shuffle, etc.
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([1,2,3,4]).shuffle(); // first time: 3 2 1 4`
		- `$('example').from([1,2,3,4]).shuffle(); // second time: 1 3 4 2`
---
- **skip** ( _prob_ )
	- Sometimes, skip executing the command, as if it had never been attempted. Useful if you only want to update the FacetPattern some of the time, but otherwise want to preserve the previous data.
		- example:
		- `$('example').spiral(16,random(1,360)).skip(0.95); // new pattern 5% of the time when this command runs`
---
- **slew** ( _depth_ = 25, _up_speed_ = 1, _down_speed_ = 1 )
	- adds upwards and/or downwards slew to the FacetPattern. `depth` controls how many slew values exist between each value. `up_speed` and `down_speed` control how long the slew lasts: at 0, the slew has no effect, whereas at 1, the slew occurs over the entire `depth` between each FacetPattern value.
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([0,0.5,0.9,0.1]).slew(25,0,1) // the first three numbers will jump immediately because upwards slew is 0. then it will slew from 0.9 to 0.1 over the course of the entire depth range`
---
- **smooth** ( )
	- interpolates each value so it falls exactly between the values that precede and follow it.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(64).smooth(); // less noisy`
---
- **sort** ( )
	- returns the FacetPattern ordered lowest to highest.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(128).sort(); // ascending values originally from noise`
---
- **speed** ( _amt_ )
	- increases or decreases the playback speed of the FacetPattern, similar to transposing audio samples up or down. An `amt` value of 0.5 will play at half speed. An `amt` value of 2 will play at double speed.
	- example
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').speed(0.2); // slow sample`
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').speed(1.5); // fast sample`
---
- **sticky** ( _amt_ )
	- samples and holds values in the FacetPattern based on probability. `amt` (float 0-1) sets the likelihood of each value being sampled and held.
	- example
		- `$('example').noise(n4).sticky(0.98); // quarter note of "sticky" noise`
---
- **stretchto** ( _num_samples_ )
	- time-stretches the FacetPattern while preserving pitch so it now lasts `num_samples` samples.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(1000,n2).stretchto(n1).play(); // 1000Hz sine wave originally a half note long, stretched to a whole note`
---
- **stutter** ( _number_of_repeats_ )
	- creates `_number_of_repeats_` identical chunks of data.
	- example
		- `$('example').iter(8,()=>{this.sup(_.randsamp('808').stutter(8),i/iters)}).play(); // 8 random 808 samples, each stuttered 8 times`
---
- **subset** ( _percentage_ )
	- returns a subset of the FacetPattern with `percentage`% values in it.
	- example:
		- `$('example').phasor(1).size(50).subset(0.3); // originally 50 values long, now 0.02 0.08 0.50 0.58 0.62 0.700 0.76 0.78 0.92`
---
- **truncate** ( _length_ )
	- truncates the FacetPattern so it's now `length` values long. If `length` is longer than the FacetPattern, return the whole FacetPattern.
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([0,1,2,3]).truncate(2); // now 2 values long`
		- `$('example').from([0,1,2,3]).truncate(6); // still 4 values long`
---
- **tune** ( _note_ = "c", _binThreshold_ = 0.005 )
	- applies a spectral gate to the FacetPattern, muting any frequency bins that do not closely map onto the supplied `note`.
	- `note` values: "A", "A#", "B", "C", "C#", "D", "D#", "E", "F", "F#", "G", "G#"
	- `binThreshold` controls how close a bin frequency must be to the supplied note's harmonics in order to be kept. For example, if `binThreshold` is set to 0.1, then a bin frequency must be within 10% of a harmonic in the supplied `note` in order to be kept.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(n1).tune('c',0.0001).play(); // tuning a whole note of noise to c`
---
- **unique** ( )
	- returns the set of unique values in the FacetPattern.
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([1,2,3,0,0.4,2]).unique(); // 1 2 3 0 0.4`
---
- **walk** ( _prob_, _amt_ )
	- changes positions in the FacetPattern.  `prob` (float 0-1) sets the likelihood of each position changing. `amt` controls how many steps the values can move. If `amt` is set to 10, and `prob` is set to 0.5 half the values could move 10 positions to the left or the right.
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([0,1,2,0,1,0.5,2,0]).walk(0.25, 3);`
---
- **wrap** ( _min_, _max_ )
	- folds FacetPattern values greater than `max` so their output continues at `min`.  If the values are twice greater than `max`, their output continues at `min` again. Similar for values less than `min`, such that they wrap around the min/max thresholds.
	- if no value is entered for `max`, then the first argument will be used to create the `min` and `max`, centered around 0. For instance, `wrap(0.3) == wrap(-0.3,0.3)`
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(100).add(-0.1).wrap(0.2,0.5).play();`
---

### Pattern modulators that can take a FacetPattern, number, or array as an argument
When a modulator takes a FacetPattern or an array as an argument, it uses that pattern to dynamically change its behavior over time, affecting the output in a more complex way than if a single number were supplied. For example, with the command `$('example').noise(16).add(4)`, all 16 output values will be between 3 and 5, because 4 is added to every noise value, and noise values are between -1 and 1 by default. But with the command `$('example').noise(16).add(_.ramp(0,4,16))`, the output values will ramp from between [-1, 1] at the beginning to between [4, 5] at the end, since the FacetPattern that is being added is a ramp of values starting at 0 and ending at 4.

- **add** ( _FacetPattern_, _match_sizes_ = true )
	- adds the first FacetPattern and the second FacetPattern. If `match_sizes` is false, the output FacetPattern will be the longer pattern's length, and the "missing" values from the shorter pattern will be set to 0. If `match_sizes` is true, both FacetPatterns will be made the same size before the calculations occur.
	- example:
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').add(_.randsamp('808')).play(); // two random samples each loop`
---
- **bpf** ( _cutoffPattern_ = 1000, _q_ = 2.5 )
	- applies a bandpass filter with configurable `cutoffPattern` and `q` to the FacetPattern.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(n1).bpf(1000,6).times(0.1).play(); // band-passed noise`
		- `$('example').noise(n1).bpf(_.sine(4).scale(10,1000)).play(); // 4-cycle LFO modulating the bandpass cutoff between 10 and 1000 Hz`
---
- **comb** ( _delaySamplesPattern_ = sample_rate / 100, _feedforward_ = 0.5, _feedback_ = 0.5 )
	- applies a comb filter to the input data. The `_delaySamplesPattern_` parameter is equal to 10ms by default and specifies the number of samples to delay the input signal. The `feedforward` parameter controls the amount of the input signal that is fed directly to the output. The `feedback` parameter controls the amount of feedback applied to the delay, allowing the delayed signal to be mixed back into the input.
	- The `feedback` and `feedforward` values are clamped between 0 and 0.98.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(n4).comb(ms(10),0.5,0.5).play();`
---
- **crush** ( _numberOfBitsPattern_, _downsamplingPattern_ )
	- applies bit crushing and / or downsampling to the incoming FacetPattern.
	- `numberOfBitsPattern` controls the bit depth for the output pattern. To hear the effect, the values need to be integers between 1 and 8. Lower values produce more drastic results.
	- `downsamplingPattern` controls the fator by which to reduce the sample rate. Values need to be integers greater than 1. Higher values produce more drastic results.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(100).crush(2).play(); // redux on the sine wave`
		- `$('example').sine(100,n1).crush(_.ramp(8,1,8)).play(); // ramping bit depth on 100Hz sine wave from 8 bits to 1`
		- `$('example').sine(100,n1).crush(_.ramp(8,1,8),_.noise(16).scale(1,40)).play(); // ramping bit depth on 100Hz sine wave from 8 bits to 1, and dynamically changing the downsampling amount between 1 and 40 samples`
---
- **delay** ( _delaySamplesPattern_, _feedback_ = 0.5 )
	- delays the input FacetPattern by `delaySamplesPattern` samples. The `feedback` parameter controls the amount of feedback applied to the delay, allowing the delayed signal to be mixed back into the input.
	- the maximum `feedback` value is 0.975.
	- example:
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').delay(random(1700,10000)).play();`
---
- **divide** ( _FacetPattern_, _match_sizes_ = true )
	- divides the first FacetPattern by the second. If `match_sizes` is false, the output FacetPattern will be the longer pattern's length, and the "missing" values from the shorter pattern will be set to 0. If `match_sizes` is true, both FacetPatterns will be made the same size before the calculations occur.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(1).divide(_.from([0.5,0.25,0.1,1]));`
---
- **ffilter** ( _minFreqPattern_, _maxFreqPattern_, _invertMode_ = false)
	- applies a spectral filter to the FacetPattern, passing only the frequency bins between `minFreqPattern` and `maxFreqPattern`.
	- you can invert the filter mode so it cuts all the bins between `minFreqPattern` and `maxFreqPattern` by sending a truthy value for `invertMode.`
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(n16).ffilter(200,2000).play(); // noise between 200Hz - 2000Hz`
---
- **fgate** ( _gateThresholdPattern_ = 0.1, _invertMode_ = false )
	- applies a spectral gate to the FacetPattern, muting any frequency bins lower than `gateThresholdPattern`. The magnitudes of each FFT bin are normalized from 0 - 1. A `gateThresholdPattern` of 0 will pass every bin, and a `gateThresholdPattern` of 1 will mute every bin.
	- you can invert the gate mode so it keeps only bins with magnitudes lower than  `gateThresholdPattern`.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(n16).fgate(0.7).play(); // try experimenting with different threshold values`
---
- **flookup** ( _lookupPattern_ )
	- applies a spectral bin rearrangement to the FacetPattern based on the `lookupPattern`. Similar to `ichunk()` but using FFT. The `lookupPattern` maps the current spectral bins to new positions. The length of the lookupPattern determines the number of frames in the resynthesized signal.
	- example:
		`$('example').randsamp('808').flookup(_.ramp(1,0,SAMPLE_RATE)).play().once(); // backwards 808 sample, ramping from relative position 1 to 0`
---
- **fshift** ( _shiftAmountPattern_ )
	- applies a spectral bin shift to the FacetPattern. `shiftAmountPattern` values lower than 0 will cause the bottom to wrap the top, and the rest of the spectrum moves downwards. `shiftAmountPattern` values higher than 0 will cause the top of the spectrum to wrap to the bottom, and the rest of the spectrum moves upwards.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(100).fshift(0.04).play(); // try experimenting with different shift values `
---
- **ftilt** ( _tiltAmountPattern_ )
    - applies spectral harmonic tilting to the FacetPattern. This method allows for the rotation of the harmonic bands of the signal, enabling each band to be repositioned independently in time. The `tiltAmountPattern` should be normalized to values between -1 and 1, where -1 represents a full counter-clockwise rotation and 1 represents a full clockwise rotation.
    - example:
        - `$('example').sample('808/808-Clap03').ftilt(_.ramp(rf(),rf(),100)).play(); // split the clap sample into 100 frequency bands and disperse them randomly in time`
---
- **harmonics** ( _numHarmonicsPattern_ )
	- adds `numHarmonicsPattern` harmonics to the input signal.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(10).harmonics(200).play(); // 10Hz sine wave with 200 harmonics added on top`
		- `$('example').sine(10,n1).harmonics(_.ramp(0,200,200)).play(); // ramping up from 0 harmonics on the 10Hz wave to 200 harmonics`
---
- **hpf** ( _cutoffPattern_ = 100, _q_ = 2.5 )
	- applies a high pass filter with configurable `cutoffPattern` and `q` to the FacetPattern.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(n1).hpf(2000,6).times(0.1).play(); // high-passed noise`
		- `$('example').noise(n1).hpf(_.sine(4).scale(10000,20000)).play(); // 4-cycle LFO modulating the high pass cutoff between 10000 and 20000 Hz`
---
- **lpf** ( _cutoffPattern_ )
	- applies a low pass filter with configurable `cutoffPattern` and `q` to the FacetPattern.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(n1).lpf(1000,6).times(0.1).play(); // low-passed noise`
		- `$('example').noise(n1).lpf(_.sine(4).scale(10,2000)).play(); // 4-cycle LFO modulating the high pass cutoff between 10 and 2000 Hz`
---
- **pitch** (  _pitchShiftPattern_ )
	- pitch-shifts the FacetPattern. `pitchShiftPattern` values between 0 and 1 will lower the pitch; e.g. a value of 0.5 will shift it down an octave. Values higher than 1 will increase the pitch; e.g. a value of 2 will be an octave higher.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(100).shift(rf(0.5,2)); // sometimes lower pitch, sometimes higher pitch`
		- `$('example').sine(100).pitch(_.noise(16).scale(0.5,2)).play(); // pitch shifts a 100Hz wave at 16 places, sometimes lower and sometimes higher`
---
- **stretch** ( _shiftAmountPattern_, _chunksPerSecondPattern_ = 128 )
	- time-stretches the FacetPattern while preserving pitch. `shiftAmountPattern` values less than 1 will shorten its overall length; values greater than 1 will increase its length. `chunksPerSecondPattern` is the number of chunks that the timestretching algorithm will generate per second. Smaller values will produce more discrete repetitions; larger values will produce more of a bitcrushing, harmonic distortion effect. The largest `chunksPerSecondPattern` value is `SAMPLE_RATE / (SAMPLE_RATE * 0.002)`, which is 500 a sample rate of 44100.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(100,n4).stretch(4).play(); // stretching a quarter note sine wave to last a whole note`
		- `$('example').noise(n1).stretch(_.ramp(0.125,4,16)).play().once(); // stretching a whole note of noise over 16 ramped values, starting at 8x faster and ending at 4x slower`
---
- **subtract** ( _FacetPattern_, _match_sizes_ = true )
	- subtracts the second FacetPattern from the first. If `match_sizes` is false, the output FacetPattern will be the longer pattern's length, and the "missing" values from the shorter pattern will be set to 0. If `match_sizes` is true, both FacetPatterns will be made the same size before the calculations occur.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(100).subtract(_.cosine(50)).play();`
---
- **tanh** ( _gainPattern_ = 20 )
	- outputs the hyperbolic tangent method for the input FacetPattern, always returning values between -1 and 1. Higher `gainPattern` values will create more intense distortion.
	- example:
		- `$('example').phasor(1,20).times(10).tanh(6); // 0 0.995 0.9999 0.99999996 0.9999999999 0.999999999999 0.9999999999999996 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
		- `$('example').sine(100).tanh(_.ramp(0,100,100)).play(); // ramping tanh distortion up on a 100Hz sine wave`
---
- **times** ( _FacetPattern_, _match_sizes_ = true)
	- multiplies the first FacetPattern by the second. If `match_sizes` is false, the output FacetPattern will be the longer pattern's length, and the "missing" values from the shorter pattern will be set to 0. If `match_sizes` is true, both FacetPatterns will be made the same size before the calculations occur.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(50).times(_.sine(50)).play();`

### Pattern modulators that must take a second FacetPattern as an argument
- **and** ( _FacetPattern_, _match_sizes_ = true )
	- computes the logical AND of both FacetPattern, returning a 0 if one of the values is 0 and returning a 1 if both of the values are nonzero. If `match_sizes` is false, the output FacetPattern will be the longer pattern's length, and the "missing" values from the shorter pattern will be set to 0. If `match_sizes` is true, both FacetPatterns will be made the same size before the calculations occur.
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([1,0,1,0]).and(_.from([0,1])); // 0 0 1 0`
---
- **append** ( _FacetPattern_ )
	- concatenates the second FacetPattern onto the first.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(1).append(_.phasor(1)).append(_.from([1,2,3,4]));`
---
- **chaos** ( _FacetPattern_, _iterations_ = 100, _cx_ = 0, _cy_ = 0)
	- each piece of data in the FacetPattern is paired with the corresponding value in the second FacetPattern. The resulting complex number x,y coordinate is run through a function: f(x) = x2 + c, over `iterations` iterations. The output is a value between 0 and 1, which corresponds to how stable or unstable that particular point is in the complex number plane.
	- By default, both cx and cy are set to 0 (Mandelbrot set). But you can set them to other values from -1 to 1, which can produce all sorts of Julia set variations.
	- example: `$('example').sine(n1).chaos(_.drunk(n1,0.01)).play();`
---
- **convolve** ( _FacetPattern_ )
	- computes the convolution between the two FacetPatterns.
	- example:
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').convolve(_.randsamp('808')).play();	// convolving random samples`
---
- **equals** ( _FacetPattern_, _match_sizes_ = true )
	- computes the logical EQUALS of both FacetPattern, returning a 0 if the values don't equal each other and returning a 1 if they do. If `match_sizes` is false, the output FacetPattern will be the longer pattern's length, and the "missing" values from the shorter pattern will be set to 0. If `match_sizes` is true, both FacetPatterns will be made the same size before the calculations occur.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(1).equals(_.sine(2));`
---
- **ichunk** ( _FacetPattern_ )
	- slices the input into `FacetPattern.length` windowed chunks (to avoid audible clicks). Loops through every value of `FacetPattern` as a lookup table, determining which ordered chunk of audio from the input sequence it corresponds to, and appends that window to the output buffer.
	- example:
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').ichunk(_.ramp(rf(),rf(),256)).play(); // play 256 slices between two random points of a random sample... timestretching :)`
---
- **interlace** ( _FacetPattern_ )
	- interlaces two FacetPatterns. If one FacetPattern is smaller, it will be interspersed evenly throughout the other FacetPattern.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(1).interlace(_.phasor(1,20));`
---
- **map** ( _FacetPattern_ )
	- forces all values of the input FacetPattern to be mapped onto a new set of values from a second FacetPattern.**
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([1,2,3,4]).map([11,12,13,14]); // 11 11 11 11`
		- `$('example').from([1,2,3,4]).scale(30,34).map(_.from([31,31.5,32,32.5])); // 31 31.5 32.5 32.5`
---
- **or** ( _FacetPattern_, _match_sizes_ = false )
	- computes the logical OR of both FacetPattern, returning a 0 if both of the values are 0 and returning a 1 if either of the values are nonzero. If `match_sizes` is false, the output FacetPattern will be the longer pattern's length, and the "missing" values from the shorter pattern will be set to 0. If `match_sizes` is true, both FacetPatterns will be made the same size before the calculations occur.
	- example:
		- `$('example').from([1,0,1,0]).or(_.from([0,1])); // 1 0 1 1`
---
- **sieve** ( _FacetPattern_ )
	- uses the second FacetPattern as a lookup table, with each value's relative value determining which value from the input sequence to select.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(1024).sieve(_.sine(10)); // sieving noise with a sine wave into the audio rate :D`
---
- **splice** ( _FacetPattern_, _position_  )
	- inserts the second FacetPattern into the input FacetPattern at relative `position` between 0 and 1.
	- example:
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').splice(_.noise(n16),0.5).play(); // inserts a 16th note of noise halfway through the random sample`
---
- **sup** ( _FacetPattern_, _startPositionPattern_, _maxFrameSize_ = whole_note_samples )
	- superposes a second FacetPattern onto the first. The `startPositionPattern` value can be any value between 0 and 1, or an array, or a FacetPattern. It controls the relative position(s) in the input FacetPattern to begin superposing `FacetPattern`. The `maxFrameSize` value specifies the farthest sample value from the first FacetPattern, which would be equal to a `startPosition` of 1.
	- example:
		- `$('example').silence(n1).sup(_.randsamp('808'),0,n1).sup(_.randsamp('808'),0.5,n1).play(); // superpose two samples at the 0% and 50% points through each loop`
- **vocode** ( _carrierPattern_ )
	- creates a vocoder effect where the amplitude envelope of each frequency bin in the input FacetPattern controls the amplitude of each freuqency bin in `carrierPattern`.
	- for a "classic" vocoding effect, use a rhythmic sample as the input FacetPattern and a melodic pattern for `carrierPattern`.
	- example:
		- `$('example').seq('808/* 808/* 808/* 808/* 808/* 808/* 808/* 808/*').vocode(_.square([220,440,110,110])).play(); // vocode sequence of random 808 sample with simple square wave pattern`

### Pattern modulators with a function as one of the arguments
For more examples, refer to the `examples/this.md` file.

- **mix** ( _wet_, _command_ = function )
	- Mixes the input FacetPattern with a second FacetPattern generated by `command`.
	- The command that will be mixed must start with the reserved word: `this` (see example).
	- example:
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').mix(0.5,()=>{this.reverse().speed(2).echo(8).speed(10)}).play();`
---
- **iter** ( _num_times_, _command_ = function, _prob_ = 1 )
	- A shorthand for rerunning a certain command over and over, with prob as a float between 0 and 1 controlling the likelihood that the code actually runs.
	- You can refer to the current iteration of the algorithm via the reserved word: `this` (see example).
	- The variable `i`, referring to the current iteration number starting at 0, is also available for use in commands.
	- The variable `iters`, referring to the total number of iterations, is also available for use in commands.
	- The variable `this.original_data`, referring to the original data before any iterations are proessed, is also available for use in commands.
	- example:
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').iter(8,()=>{this.delay(ri(1,2000))}).play(); // 8 delay lines between 1 and 2000 samples`
---
- **parallel** ( _commands_ = [function, function] )
	- applies multiple commands in parallel to the input FacetPattern. The `commands` parameter is an array where each entry is a function. Each `command` is applied to a copy of the original input data, and the results are combined back together afterwards. The final output is normalized to have the same maximum value as the original input data.
	- example: `$('s').noise(n4).scale(-1,1).allpass(347).allpass(113).allpass(37).parallel([()=>{this.delay(1687,0.999)},()=>{this.delay(1601,0.999)},()=>{this.delay(2053,0.999)},()=>{this.delay(2251,0.999)}]).play().full(); // schroeder reverb on a quarter note of noise`
---
- **run** ( _commands_ = function )
	- equivalent to a `sometimes(1,()=>{})` method. See `sometimes()` below for more details.
	- allows you to run arbitrary JS code on the FacetPattern every loop.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(n1).run(()=>{if(bars%2==0){this.tune('c')}else {this.tune('g')}}).play(); // alternating c and g whole notes made from tuned noise`
---
- **seq** ( _sequencePattern_, _commands_ = function )
	- superposes the samples specified in `sequencePattern` across the loop. `sequencePattern` can either be a string or a FacetPattern composed of strings.
	- the character `*` at the end of a member of the `sequencePattern` string will select a random sample from that directory (see examples).
	- the character `_` in a `sequencePattern` specifies to insert silence instead of a sample.
	- the `commands` will run on each sample as it is superposed onto the output pattern.
	- example: 
		- `$('example').seq('kicks/* hats/* snares/003 hats/003').play(); // random kick, random hat, snares/003, hats/003`
		- `$('example').seq(_.from(['kicks/003', 'hats*', 'snares/003', 'hats/*']).dup(choose([1, 3, 5, 7])).palindrome().rechunk(8, 0.5), () => {this.log(rf()).delay(ri(n128, n16))}).full().play() // example using commands to proess each sample, and using a FacetPattern as the sequencePattern`;
---
- **slices** ( _num_slices_, _command_ = function, _prob_ = 1, _fade_mode_ = true )
	- slices the FacetPattern into `num_slices` slices, and for `prob` percent of those slices, runs `command`, appending all slices back together. You can refer to the current slice of the algorithm via the reserved word: `this` (see example).
	- The variable `s`, referring to the current slice number starting at 0, is also available for use in commands.
	- The variable `num_slices`, referring to the number of slices, is also available for use in commands.
	- If the FacetPattern's data is >= 1024 samples, the last 1% of each slice will be faded out to prevent clicks in audio slices. If the FacetPattern's data is < 1024 samples, no fading is applied, and each slice is processed exactly as-is.
	- By default, the `slices()` method applies a very short fadeout on each slice to prevent any clicks that might occur from any code running on each slice. This behavior can be turned off by including a falsy `fade_mode` value.
	- example:
		- `$('example').randsamp('808').slices(32,()=>{this.fft().shift(random()).ifft()}).play();`
---
- **sometimes** ( _prob_, _command_ = function() )
	- runs `command` only some of the time, at a probability set by `prob`.
	- `command` must start with the reserved word: `this` (see example).
	- example:
		- `$('example').phasor(1).sticky(0.5).scale(40,80).sometimes(0.5,()=>this.reverse());`
---
- **subrange** ( _min_, _max_, _command_ = function() )
	- runs `command` on a subrange of the FacetPattern, specified by `min` and `max`.
	- `min` and `max` should be floats between 0 and 1. They are relative values, so a value of 0 means the beginning of the pattern, and a value of 1 means the end of the pattern.
	- `command` must start with the reserved word: `this` (see example).
	- example:
		- `$('example').tri(200).subrange(0.33,0.66,()=>{this.times(0.25)}).play(); // quieter in the middle third`

### Methods for image generation and processing

**NOTE:** 2D images are expected to have sizes that are a perfect square. This means that the width and height of the produced image are integers. Some methods will produce distorted output or throw errors if you try to run them with patterns that are not perfect squares.

- **circle2d** ( _centerX_, _centerY_, _radius_, _value_, _fillMode_ = 0 )
    - adds a circle on top of the existing data in a FacetPattern.
	- `centerX` and `centerY` are the x,y coordinates of the center of the circle.
	- `radius` controls the radius of the circle.
	- `value` is brightness value for the circle normalized between 0 - 1.
	- `fillMode` (0 or 1) controls whether the inside of the shape is filled in with `value` or ignored. Default is no fill.
    - example:
		- `$('example').silence(1000000).circle2d(100,100,100,1).saveimg('example_circle'); // white circle in a 1000x1000 image`
        - `$('example').silence(1000000).circle2d(100,100,100,1,1250,800).saveimg('example_circle',[1,1,1],1250,800); // white circle in a 1250x800 image`
---
- **delay2d** (_delayX_, _delayY_, _intensityDecay_ = 0.5 )
    - applies a delay effect to the data in a FacetPattern in 2 dimensions.
    - `delayX` and `delayY` are the delay amounts in the x and y directions. Positive values move right/down; negative values move left/up.
    - `intensityDecay` is a value between 0 and 1 that controls how much the intensity of the data decays with each delay step. A value of 0.5 means the intensity is halved with each delay step.
    - example:
        - `$('example').silence(1000000).circle2d(500, 500, 250, 1).delay2d(20, 20, 0.85).saveimg('delay2d').once(); // circle echoing down-left`
---
- **draw2d** ( _coordinates_, _fillValue_ )
    - Draws a polygon on the FacetPattern using the provided coordinates and fill value. The polygon is drawn by connecting each pair of consecutive points in the coordinates array with a line filled with the fill value.
    - The `coordinates` parameter is an array of x and y coordinates for the vertices of the polygon. The array length must be divisible by 2.
    - The `fillValue` parameter is the value used to fill the lines of the polygon.
    - example:
        - `$('example').silence(10000).draw2d([0, 0, 99, 99], 1).saveimg('draw2d').once(); // draw a line from (0, 0) to (99, 99) with a fill value of 1`
---
- **grow2d** ( _iterations_, _prob_, _threshold_ = 0, _mode_ = 0 )
    - applies a growth algorithm to the FacetPattern in 2D space. The algorithm iterates over each "pixel" in the pattern and, based on a probability, spreads its value to adjacent pixels.
    - The `iterations` parameter determines how many times the algorithm is applied to the pattern.
    - The `prob` parameter is the probability that a pixel's value will spread to its neighbors.
    - The `threshold` parameter is a value that a pixel's value is compared to in order to determine whether it should spread. The default value is 0.
    - The `mode` parameter determines how the threshold is applied. If `mode` is 0 (the default), a pixel's value will spread if it is less than the threshold. If `mode` is 1, a pixel's value will spread if it is greater than the threshold.
    - example:
        - `$('example').noise(1000000).grow2d(5, 0.5, 0.2, 1).saveimg('grow2d').once(); // apply the growth algorithm to a noise pattern`
---
- **layer2d** ( _brightness_data_, _xCoords_, _yCoords_ )
	- superposes a FacetPattern in 2 dimensions on top of the existing data in a FacetPattern.
	- `brightness_data` is a FacetPattern that should be normalized between 0 and 1. It controls how bright the corresponding pixels will be.
	- `xCoords` and `yCoords` are FacetPatterns that allow the user to control the x,y position of the pixels in `brightness_data`.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(1).size(10000).scale(0,1).layer2d(_.noise(10000), _.ramp(0,100,128), _.ramp(0,100,128)).saveimg('example').once(); // layers a ramp from 0,0 to 100,100 over a sine wave background`
---
- **mutechunks2d** ( _num_chunks_, _probabilty_ )
	- slices the input FacetPattern into `chunks` chunks in 2D space and mutes `prob` percent of them.
	- `num_chunks` must have an integer square root, e.g. 9, 16, 25, 36.
	- example:
		`$('example').sine(0.3,1000).scale(0,1).mutechunks2d(36,0.5).saveimg('example').once();`
---
- **palindrome2d** ( )
    - generates a 2D palindrome of the input FacetPattern, mirrored in both x and y axes.
    - example:
        - `$('example').silence(1000000).iter(128,()=>{this.rect2d(ri(0,1000), ri(0,1000), ri(10,100), ri(10,100), rf())}).palindrome2d().invert().saveimg('palindrome2d',[_.ramp(rf(),rf(),1000000),_.ramp(rf(),rf(),1000000),_.ramp(rf(),rf(),1000000)]); // 128 rectangles in a 2d palindrome`
---
- **rechunk2d** ( _num_chunks_ )
	- slices the input FacetPattern into `chunks` chunks in 2D space and shuffles the chunks around.
	- `num_chunks` must have an integer square root, e.g. 9, 16, 25, 36.
	- example:
		`$('example').sine(0.3,1000).scale(0,1).rechunk2d(36).saveimg('example').once();`
---
- **rect2d** ( _topLeftX_, _topLeftY_, _rectWidth_, _rectHeight_, _value_, _fillMode_ = 0 )
    - adds a rectangle on top of the existing data in a FacetPattern.
	- `topLeftX` and `topLeftY` are the x,y coordinates of the top-left corner of the rectangle.
	- `rectWidth` and `rectHeight` control the size of the rectangle.
	- `value` is brightness value for the rectamgle normalized between 0 - 1.
	- `fillMode` (0 or 1) controls whether the inside of the shape is filled in with `value` or ignored. Default is no fill.
    - example:
        - `$('example').silence(1000000).rect2d(0,0,100,100,1).saveimg('rect2d'); // 100x100 white square in top-left corner of 1000x1000 image`
---
- **rotate** ( _angle_ )
	- rotates the FacetPattern `angle` degrees around a center point, as if it were suspended in 2D space.
	- the `width` and `height` arguments are optional. They default to the square root of the FacetPattern's length. Other values will rotate the data in a different way, around a different center point.
	- example:
		- `$('example').sine(1).scale(0,1).size(512*512).rotate(35).saveimg('example').once(); // rotates a sine wave background 35 degrees`
---
- **saveimg** ( _filepath_ = Date.now(), _rgbData_ )
	- saves the FacetPattern data as a PNG file in the `img/` directory or a sub-directory. If a sub-directory is specified in the `filepath` argument and it doesn't exist, it will be created.
	- the `rgbData` argument is optional. Without it, the image will be greyscaled. If `rgbData` is included, it should be an array containing three FacetPatterns normalized to between 0 and 1, representing the R, G, and B amounts. The FacetPattern data will be multipled by the three `rgbData` patterns to create colored pixels in the image. Values between 0 and 1 will be mapped onto RGB values 0-255.
	- example:
		- ```
			$('example')
			// create black background
			.silence(512 * 512)
			// add the 512 brightest-possible pixels (1s) that will be used to create a circle
			.layer2d(_.from(1).size(512),
			// the circle x coordinates move from left edge (0) to right edge (512) and back
			_.ramp(0, 511, 512)
			.palindrome(),
			// the circle y coordinates, pt. 1: create a half-circle out of 512 values, defaulting to between 0 and 1
			_.circle(1)
			.size(512)
			// the circle y coordinates, pt. 2: append another half-circle out of 512 values, scaled between -1 and 0 and inverted
			.append(_.circle(1)
			.size(512)
			.scale(-1, 0)
			.invert())
			// scale the y coordinates so they move between 0 and 511
			.scale(0, 511))
			.saveimg('circle',
              // use 3 random ramps, 1 for each RGB channel, to create a gradient in the circle's pixels
              [_.ramp(rf(),rf(),512),_.ramp(rf(),rf(),512),_.ramp(rf(),rf(),512)]
            )
			.once();
		```
---
- **savespectrogram** ( _filePath_, _windowSize_ = 2048 )
	- saves a PNG file in the `img/` directory named `fileName.png`, with the FacetPattern's spectrogram.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(n1).ffilter(_.ramp(0,NYQUIST/2),_.ramp(NYQUIST,NYQUIST/2)).savespectrogram('mytri'+Date.now()).once();`
---
- **shift2d** ( _xAmt_, _yAmt_, _mode_ )
	- shifts the FacetPattern in 2D space, by `xAmt` pixels to the left/right, and by `yAmt` pixels up/down.
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(100*100).prob(0.001).iter(4,()=>{this.mix(0.5,()=>{this.shift2d(0,1)})}).saveimg('shift2d').once(); // slides all the pixels up 4`
---
- **size2d** ( _size_ )
	- creates a smaller image of the FacetPattern in 2D Space, according to the relative amount `size`.
	- `size` must be between 0 and 1. The new pattern will be a smaller 2D image of the input, surrounded by padding of black pixels (0s).
	- example:
		- `$('example').noise(10000).size2d(0.5).saveimg('size2d'); // 100 x 100 image with a square of noise in the center`
---
- **slices2d** ( _num_slices_, _command_ )
    - slices the FacetPattern into `num_slices` slices in a 2D grid, and for each slice, runs `command`, appending all slices back together. You can refer to the current slice of the algorithm via the reserved word: `this` (see example).
    - the variable `s`, referring to the current slice number starting at 0, is also available for use in commands.
    - the variable `num_slices`, referring to the number of slices, is also available for use in commands.
    - the `slices2d()` method does not apply any fading on each slice. Each slice is processed exactly as-is.
    - the `command` is a function that is applied to each slice. The function is converted to a string and any reference to `this` is replaced with `current_slice` to ensure the function operates on the correct data.
    - the method divides the FacetPattern into a grid of slices, each slice being a square segment of the original pattern. The number of slices is determined by the square of the nearest integer square root of `num_slices`. This ensures that the slices form a square grid.
    - example:
        - `$('example').noise(1000000).slices2d(36,()=>{this.times(rf())}).saveimg('slices2d').once();;`
---
- **spectral** ( _stretchFactor_ = 1 )
    - applies a spectral transformation to the FacetPattern, treating it as if it were a 2d spectrogram and applying an Inverse Fourier Fast Transform (IFFT).
	- this allows you to generate, interpret, and resynthesize a frequency-domain representation into sound.
    - the `stretchFactor` parameter determines how much the pattern is stretched horizontally before the IFFT is applied. The default value is 1, which means no stretching. Each row of the pattern is then stretched by the `stretchFactor`. This is done by linearly interpolating between each pair of consecutive values in the row.
    - example:
        - `$('example').silence(1000000).iter(16,()=>{this.circle2d(ri(0,999),ri(0,999),ri(0,100),rf())}).spectral().play().full().once(); // 16 circles randomly dispersed and superposed around the audio spectrum`
---
- **tri2d** ( _x1_, _y1_, _x2_, _y2_, _x3_, _y3_, _value_, _fillMode_ = 0 )
    - adds a triangle on top of the existing data in a FacetPattern.
	- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, and `y3` define the triangle's position in the 2d space.
	- `value` is brightness value for the triangle normalized between 0 - 1.
	- `fillMode` (0 or 1) controls whether the inside of the shape is filled in with `value` or ignored. Default is no fill.
    - example:
        - `$('example').silence(1000000).tri2d(ri(0,1000), ri(0,1000), ri(0,1000), ri(0,1000), ri(0,1000), ri(0,1000),1).saveimg('tri2d'); // one random white triangle in a 1000x1000 image`
---
- **warp2d** ( _warpX_, _warpY_, _warpIntensity_ )
	- applies a warp effect to the FacetPattern, pulling it towards a given point in 2D space.
	- `warpX` and `warpY` are the x and y coordinates of the warp point.
	- `warpIntensity` should be a float between 0 and 1 and controls the intensity of the warp effect.
	- example: `$('example').silence(1000000).circle2d(100, 100, 100, 0.2).delay2d(20, 20, 0.98).iter(4,()=>{this.warp2d(ri(0,999),ri(0,999),rf())}).saveimg('warp2d'); // echoing circles warped to a random position in the 2d space`
---
- **walk2d** ( _percentage_, _x_, _y_, _mode_ = 0 )
    - generates a 2D random walk for the FacetPattern.
	- `percentage` should be a float between 0 and 1 and controls the percentage of pixels to move.
	- `x` and `y` control the maximum distance that a pixel can move. They should be non-negative integers (but random walks occur in both left/right AND up/down),
	- `mode` controls the behavior of pixels at the boundary. A value of 0 is "wrap" mode; values move to the other side. A value of 1 is "fold" mode; values get folded back by however many they exeeded the boundary. A value of 2 is "clip" mode; values get stuck at the boundary.
    - example:
        - `$('example').silence(1000000).rect2d(950, 950, 50, 50, 1).walk2d(0.5, 10, 10, 0).saveimg('walk2d'); // white square in bottom corner, 50% random walked by 10px in all 4 directions`
